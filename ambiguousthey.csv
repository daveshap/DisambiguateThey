It is really not that expensive and it can keep you from having to make HORRIBLE choices. One of the most expensive parts of veterinary care is diagnostic testing when your pet is ill but they don?t know what?s wrong. It can cost $409-$800 for something like an ultrasound or an MRI, you might need biopsies and blood draws and x-rays. X-rays can be $70-$250 depending on whether the vet can read them or if they need to bring in a specialist. And until you do those, *you will have no idea whether this is an easily fixable problem and one surgery or medication will fix it and give them 10 more happy years, or if this is a terminal illness and you should let them go peacefully.* Do you want to have to NOT figure out what?s wrong and either preemptively put them down or let them suffer because you can?t afford the tests to give you an explanation? I hope not.

My coworker has two young cats, and told me in Feb he was thinking of getting rid of his pet insurance and just self-insuring. I convinced him not to. 3 months later, his young cat isn?t eating much and is throwing up. He takes her to the vet and there is something hard in her belly. They do a blood draw and an x-ray; calcium levels are high but they can?t tell what the hardness is - it could be a tumor or something more benign. The only way to tell is an ultrasound. He thanked me profusely for encouraging him to keep the pet insurance because he can afford to get the ultrasound to see what?s wrong, and if she needs surgery or ongoing medication, he won?t have to bear the full cost. If he couldn?t afford it, he would have to give her some meds that would *maybe* cover up her symptoms and hope that it?s not cancer and that she can get better, or that he can give her at least a tolerable quality of life while only treating the symptoms.

Don?t let yourself be put in a situation where you can?t afford to know how to make your pet healthy and happy again. And there is no guarantee that they won?t have some accident or illness before you?ve saved up $ by saving the cost you would be paying in premiums and trying to self-insure. Plus, plenty of dogs develop chronic illnesses that are completely manageable with meds, but they have to take those meds for years and they might be expensive. Dogs have allergies to grass and pollen (environmental allergies usually don?t show up until later in life) and the meds for that can be pricey but they are really effective. I have a friend who can only afford to get her dog the magic allergy shot every 3 months, so her dog is just miserable for a month and a half in-between. It?s so sad.

Edited to add: we have used Embrace for two dogs and they?re excellent. They cover cancer, allergies, meds, acupuncture.. you name it. $40/mo for $1k deductible per year with 90% covered up to that, max benefit of $30k. Our new dog developed a pinched nerve issue a few months after we got her and the coverage has been a godsend because we couldn?t have afforded the meds and treatments that are helping. Next step is an MRI which thankfully will be a fraction of the real cost and we might need surgery or physical therapy after that. It?s terrible, when she isn?t being treated/medicated she moves in a certain way and then just SCREAMS. But, pet insurance saved us. Our last dog had an autoimmune issue that would give her horrible and gross tushy issues and needed a daily medication that would have been $200/mo without insurance, but neither we nor she could live like she was living without that treatment.

"&gt; I thought the fact they were gay would be a bigger issue in the community. The couple wasn't out but people knew, with having a male servant being rare and him being single. I would imagine a community that took its morals that seriously would pry into that more.

The Klan invades their house for this exact reason. There even have a meeting about it. Church blackmails him into silence about it. The very first scene is the new lady moving in talking about how weird this is to her. Link's whole reason for moving to France is so they can live more openly. Jonas gets bullied for being gay. The cops harass Link because they think he's gay. I don't know how you missed this thread.

&gt;I'm not sure how the curtain was lifted on the power imbalance when from the start Uno is Link's servant, and I didn't get the impression that Uno was an unwilling participant until the hypnosis reveal. I didn't pick up on the noteworthiness of the power imbalance between the couple because during that time nearly all relationships regardless of race had a power imbalance. Stories about interracial/interclass love usually show that the minority partner is more disadvantaged and has more challenges than the majority, but ultimately it's more about the greater power imbalance which is between the couple vs society.

Yeah that's kinda the point. There's no way Uno could ever be an equal partner in this relationship because he is both Black and gay and obviously much younger than Link. Before the story gets to the hypnosis reveal, there isn't supposed to be any implication Uno doesn't want to be there. Even he says at one point that he *should* want a man like Link. The curtain reveal to us and the character is when we see just how far Link was willing to go by kidnapping, raping and brainwashing a woman into having his kids. Sure he's killed people before but up until then almost every main character has a body count. But those were more in self defense. Him brutally murdering a woman he raped and kidnapped is what is supposed to break the illusion that Link is anything close to heroic. He's the main character but he's also the villain. And,I guess you can call it a twist, is that we end up seeing him as the villain when up until around midway he's not really shown that way. It's kinda like how Thanos is the main character and also the villain of Infinity War but if you didn't know who the Avengers were from the jump. I was going for a slow burn reveal. 


&gt;I never thought Link was the hero, I just said he never stops being the lead character. If Uno is supposed to be the one to root for, he shouldn't have been a side character - and he wasn't the only sympathetic one either. I disagree that in other stories Link would be the hero. He'd be an anti-hero, and making him that rather than a complete dick would be more interesting. It's a bit contradictory when you said that everyone was disgusted by Link and Church then say it was easy for them to infiltrate polite society. Church didn't really infiltrate it at all he was born privileged.

How is that a contradiction? No one we're supposed to care about starts turning on Link until his true nature is revealed. He murdered a woman and basically kidnapped another man. But none of that is known to us nor the other characters until that reveal. He's able to function mostly successful in polite society up until then. It's not until Uno starts to learn how Link truly feels about him and what he did that he begins to question his place in this relationship. 

Also as it regards Church, yes that's the point. His money and white skin allows him to command a certain level of respect regardless of the fact he's clearly an asshole. But because he's a man, he's rich and he's white his flaws are ignored or even applauded. Link thinks he's a genius for his business practices until he gets a taste of how horrible Church really is for himself. Which like I said before is the point. There are obvious monsters walking around but because they fit into the social hegemony and they by and large don't really affect anyone white and middle class on a grand scale, they ignore it. Church is Jeff Bezos. He's Elon Musk. They have people who praise their business acumen all the time. So does Church. 

&gt;The evil white men getting away with things trope is overdone but I see what you're going for in showing that they can still hold power even though they're literally vampires. I still don't get why Link wasn't run out of town already as he was a vampire with a black male servant and mixed children. He wasn't supremely powerful like Church so I don't see how him simply being white offered that much protection, especially in a society that prides itself on racial purity and morality.

When rich white men in America stop doing it in real life then I'll have something new to talk about.  But seeing as right now we are seeing a wave of authoritarianism and bargain bin fascism sweeping over the west like a plague of locusts, it's relevant. Regarding, the neighbors they do end up invading his house. He says in the script he's only been there a year and it's been an uneasy one. He's also a vampire and as vulnerable they can be, as is shown multiple times they can and will murk your ass. If you thought your new neighbor was capable of killing you, would you try him? No you'd probably shut the fuck and ignore whatever he does until it directly affects you. 

Which again, is the point of the story. There are obvious monsters living amongst us. But many of us are content to let it be to keep the peace. If there's a chance for plausible deniability most people will take it. I mean hell we see this every fucking week. Some deranged man, usually white, shoots up a building. Then everyone who knows who acts like they couldn't have possibly known and any hint they did get they ignored. Because he was such a nice guy. Link is a very nice guy. If you are on the outside. He's a loving father and decent man who might be up to something, but you can't prove it. And he's not affecting you. So why rock the boat? What if you're wrong? 

&gt;The outrage over Trump, by all in democratic and some republican circles, happened as soon as he started polling way ahead of the other primary candidates. I don't think it took as long as you're implying. White supremacists are very much not out in the open. The last white power march that had even a few dozen people was probably years ago. It's not a thing unless you're counting 3% or Patriot Prayer, but they're certainly not openly white supremacist. On average, black people have higher bone density than whites, which I assume applies to skulls as well. I don't know why you're saying that like it's a myth from the 1950s when it's in current scientific literature.

If covid never happened he'd still be president. Even CNN was giving him breaks up until he started banning journalists from his meetings. I remember Van Jones braying about 'this is the moment he became president'. No one really took this monster seriously until he fucked up the covid response. 'What has really done?' was a very common phrase up until March 2020. Until it was shown he was very content on letting white middle class people die too he was well on his way to reelection. And he didn't even lose by that much but again this isn't r/politics so I'll leave it there. 

Also what are you talking about? We don't have open white supremacists in this country? What country have you been living in the past four years? You can turn on Fox News and watch Tucker Carlson basically recite the 14 words on live TV. You elected officials saying shit like there are Jewish space lasers. White supremacists plan rallies openly and they march in the streets without masks. You have to be willingly ignorant of the situation we find ourselves in these days. 

&gt;My point in bringing that up is to say that the theme doesn't interest me personally because it's so well-worn, and that I feel there is audience fatigue towards it.

Maybe among right leaning people who wouldn't want to hear it in any context. But media responds to what the people want to talk about. We have been having a lot of conversations about how race, class, gender and so in the country in a way we haven't seen since ths 60's. Entertainment companies are meeting the moment.

"Have you ever considered that the reason custody favors women in court is because men have always pushed that women are the caretakers of children, it?s their responsibility.

Can you get them to school everyday and pick them up? If there?s a doctor appointment, can you take off time to take the child? If one of them says no, then I?m not giving them 50% custody. Men are the ones that decided women should stay home with children, shouldn?t work, shouldn?t get higher education.

"This is not something to feel awkward about. If you're self-producing, you can cast it how you like. It's called *an attachment*. That means that a certain actor or actors are attached to the production from beginning of development. 

But, the way you describe this, it seems that you not only want to star and direct, but you'd be producing it too. That's a HUGE job, even for the smallest production. I've produced around 65 projects in New York, so I know a little about this. I'd advise you to find people to jump on board with you to put this together, perhaps a one of two of the other folks who'll be playing other lead roles will want to help make this happen, or maybe people not acting in it. Start inquiring with your local theatre community. 

Break it down into smaller steps. Start small by doing a reading of the piece if you haven't already. Do a table read with other actors and a piano accompanist, to hear the piece out loud. These actors do not necessarily have to be the ones right for the roles, but right enough to see how the piece resonates. Through that process you'll be able to gauge the interest, and figure out the next steps. 

If that goes well, *inquire about the rights* and mount a public reading of the piece. If this is a published musical, you MUST obtain the rights no matter what, even if it's non-professional and you're not charging any ticket price. If you're performing it in front of an audience you must have the rights. Intellectual property is protected, and if you don't obtain them you could get into some trouble with the rights holder. I know people do this all the time, but it's really just the mark of people who aren't really serious about what they're doing. Rights for a public reading or two of musical are low, in the $100 - $200 range. If a public reading goes well, then you're beginning to develop the production. And by this point you'll see the path begin to reveal itself.

Look up the manga, you'll see the difference and what I mean big bland gore. Also you can't tell me it doesn't have a big amount of fanservice.

American cartoons having unrealistic body expectations is also a thing. It's also a problem. Even though I'm not too sure where you're going with spongebob, I'm pretty sure no one wants to become a sponge or a crab.

"It?s obvious that they must know ( even if it?s been unspoken) that their dad is a lying, hypocrite, and abusive murderer. They are still so young, immature, selfish and likely deep down afraid of their dad so they?ll go along with whatever he says.

I don?t think he abused his girls ( directly) but I guarantee he was abusive to Suzanne, at the very least emotionally, verbally, mentally and spiritually but I know men like him, hitting their wife isn?t a deal breaker for them. 
He clearly was controlling, narcissistic and a liar. 

His daughters were also his victims by the abuse im certain they experienced him pour out on their mom. 
However, it?s very natural for daughters to love their dad and not fully see his flaws. I know. I experienced it myself growing up. My dad was a drug addict and negligent but I convinced myself it was my moms fault so I didn?t feel rejected by my father. We do strange things to survive when we are children and are unable to grasp reality. 

However, I believe  deeeep down, they aren?t stupid. They lived with him all of  those years and there?s no way he was able to keep his mask on all the time, especially at home. They saw and heard only God knows what in that home, that was likely traumatic. Our brains store trauma very uniquely. Basically to continue to function, the brain bubble wraps the trauma and places it in a closet far away that we don?t dare go into. Until the day they are triggered and all the suppressed memories start floating to the surface. Then, and only then, will they be truly capable of seeing who their dad really is and who he?s really not. 

It may not happen until they have children of their own and recognize their dad didn?t have true, unconditional love for them, rather he wanted them to worship him as a hero as part of that mask.

Edited: I?m not suggesting Barry doesn?t love his daughters. He probably does as much as he?s capable but he still loves himself first.",plural_they

But what I find a bit grating about some americans is that they tend to consider their experience and perception of the world as universal, when it's not at all, and in the process they often dismiss other people life experience just because it doesn't fit in their understanding of the world. For example when they will argue with you that what they perceive you to be must be your identity while completely ignoring that not all the contexts in the world resemble theirs.

"I think the point is not that ""choices don't matter"", but that they advertise that ""your choices have great impact in the world and the story"" and then your choices only change that a character dies, or what you say in the last cutscene. Let's take for example Fallout 3 and New Vegas. 

In Fallout 3, your choices only impact your reputation after the ending (you either are a scumbag or a hero) but the result is pretty much the same (the same action is performed). Hell, even the only logical choice (the one where NO ONE DIES) is blocked by the game because ""that's your destiny, not mine"" (or some other bullshit cliche). From a pure tabletop RPG perspective, this would be called ""railroading"" and the players would get (reasonably) angry.

In Fallout New Vegas, you can literally choose if people die or not, what factions survive and what factions gets destroyed, and how the world will be after the ending. 

I get that it's not always possible to have multiple endings, or have different ways to obtain the same objective. But I would accept also minor impacts in the game, but that let you feel the world as alive and that the main character is an (important) part of it.

"I think the Children work as they are, there are decent people there who signed up for all sorts of reasons. Some of them get indoctrinated, some of them just keep their heads down and get by. It seems fine to me that they're used as a parallel to the crusades and similar atrocities. And we do have the contrast between the regular Children and the Questioners who are a whole different breed of awful. Maybe the TV show can do a better job though of highlighting some of the disparate points of view of people inside the organisation. 

Maybe the disconnect stems from a lack of normal, everyday displays of religion outside of the Children. There are loads of expressions about ""praying to the Light/Creator"" etc., the Dragon's Fang, and of course we see the Shienaran attitude to death, but these often feel like fairly innocuous phrases. I guess we don't really see major characters with any sort of holy scripture (except for the Prophecies), sitting down to pray or attending some kind of place of worship.

I don't think that every world needs to have those things though. The Aiel believe very strongly in ji'e'toh, the Tuatha'an believe in the Way of the Leaf and the search for the Song, the way the Seanchan Empress and the High Blood are treated is very ritualistic, etc etc. People generally believe in the Creator, the Pattern, the Dark One and the Dragon with various ways of expressing that.

"I think GSF, before the war, was internally rotting as all our enemies were beaten.

Once the rebuilding phase within Delve was complete, we turned our aim to crush Panfam.

We tried without the superfleet in Saranen, didn't went so well.

We brought the superfleet to 9-4RP2 and got crushed, PTSD and had to go home with bonus low morale.

But then, Co2 did a Co2. And we finished them.

A few months went by, our hate was still burning. Most Imperium PVPers were deployed in SIGs into hostile territories.

Panfam went south to beat up Legacy, we answered Legacy call to arms. That invasion culminated in UALX as the Imperium jumped in to help Legacy while knowing NC. was getting really close to beating us to it. Sadly, we crashed the node. It resulted in Panfam being camped.

We used the opportunity to call the Imperium to war and deployed the main fleet north. We took Fountain, glassed Outer Ring and Cloud Ring, crushed Co2 again (lol at Gigx placing himself as if it was his wife Fcing), started the glassing of Fade, Pure Blind and Deklein. 

Then X47 happened. Where the Imperial Legacy played Whack-a-mole with Panfam. Where PL played cowardly and fucked up their cyno, leaving GOTG and NC. to die.

Shortly after, GOTG/DeadCo surrendered their Faction Fortizars in exchange for both the end of the hostilities and a (12? 18? 24? Don't remember.) Non-Aggression Pact.

We went home. To recover, rest, build some more. To brood and plan our next steps. A month after the end of the NAP, we came back. To glass all that was left. Panfam had just finished off DeadCo and was embroiled in a war with the Paper Dragon that was the Russian Drone Lands empire. Instead of fighting us, they ran into the Drone Lands, leaving the renters to die.

We finished the glassing of tribute and what they rebuilt during the previous glassing. 

Also, lol at NC. / PL / PH who prefered to transfer the structures to alt corps outside of the alliance instead of having red on the killboard.

And so, our hate and our enemy was beaten. We went home, victorious. But something was brewing. We were rotting, as no-one was willing to fight mainfleet anymore. Only SIGs had fights. The others were bored. The most fun I had during this time was headshotting the incursion in 1DQ.

Until Legacy, headed by TAPI, ended both the Imperial Legacy and our NIP. Then, they allied with our common enemy, thus becoming the enemy. The Horn of Goondor sang. Our once nearly completely decayed empire had life returning to it. Faces we had no seen in ages answered the call.

"Even though I have an analytical background I can't say that I have specific metrics. #1 is feeling like it is undervalued compared to market, which means looking at listings and sales all the time. And/or, #2 is seeing the path to value: This property could be worth $X more if Y was done. For me, ""$X more"" should be 20%+/yr, ideally 50%+. Typically this means you are taking on risk that the open market doesn't want to deal which suppresses the asking price.

Do you see an estate sale of a hoarder where they take the pictures with all the junk in the house? Opportunity. Vacant commercial building with good bones but broken windows, a leaking roof etc?

"Well that is your opinion and that is fine, but there is no need to insult the writer and call her names. She was not the only person to write episodes for the season, I would imagine other people helped. 

The Bebbanburg plot wasn?t that far off from how it happens in the books. It was a bit shocking to see Beocca die, but they have done that before in the show (Ragnar, Thyra, Steapa are a few examples). Uhtred also meets Haesten in almost every book from book 2 onward until book 9, sometimes they meet more than once per book. It?s not unrealistic that they meet in the season at multiple points. It was however unrealistic for Haesten to just leave the most dangerous warrior in all of England tied upside down with his most trusted warriors. That was poorly done, it was a cartoon moment, like something from Tom &amp; Jerry.

Our rocket Richard winner couldn't produce. 

We lost to an interim coach and a lineup that would be AHL players mostly on other squads. 

We won 3 in a row and then proceeded to lose 3 straight. 2 of them on shitty shitty overtime brain-dead plays. 

We built the best cup contending roster money could by and couldn't bear the HABS of all teams.

We iced a 40+ year old who should not be playing hockey. And then gave him 15 mins of icetime a night. 

We battled injury and somehow our depth couldn't clinch.

"This might not do as much damage as you and your players think. RAW, Move Earth needs to be cast on an area of terrain, which means the surface. It allows the caster to change the terrain as they choose, but only 20 feet in each direction (*""The extent of any such changes can?t exceed half the area?s largest dimension.""*). RAW, the players would only be able to dig trenches, not create caverns, as the spell only adjusts the terrain's elevation, but their plan is really cool so you should give them that one. The enemy army would take a tumble of 20 feet down, minus the thickness of the surface dirt layer (if there's 5ft of dirt on the surface, the fall would really only be 15 feet because the 5ft of dirt drops along with them). RAW, every enemy who falls would take between 1d6 and 2d6 points of bludgeoning damage. That's far from deadly for hardened mercenaries, and the army could try to retreat and fight another day. Your players would need to follow up on this plan if they want to do any real damage, for example by surrounding the fallen troops and pelting them with projectiles, or filling the hole with water from a nearby river and trying to drown them. **If the players do nothing to take advantage of their scheme, remember this: enemy armies retreat when their position is unfavorable.** Generals usually avoid fighting battles if they know or expect that they are going to lose.

There are a lot of RAWs in there so be sure to apply rule of cool where it's appropriate.

There are a few other aspects you could consider, but not all of them will be fun for your players since they basically cancel their cool plan:

\- How close are the PCs playing this to the chest? How are they keeping their plan quiet? The soon-to-be-trapped area needs to be evacuated as soon as they start digging, and heavy troop movements would be impossible in areas with caverns underneath. Is it even possible to keep this plan a secret? A realistic enemy would have spies or scouts in place to survey the defenses of the city and figure out what they are preparing. They might not figure out where the caverns are exactly, but they could learn the broad strokes of the plan and adjust their strategy. I'm assuming the players don't have spies or scouts to send, so you should probably have the rulers of Fairwind send spies. This serves two purposes: your players will feel like their ally is useful, and your players might catch on to the idea that the enemy also has spies. \***This one might not be fun because if the enemy learns of their plan they will have wasted a month on creating a massive hazard near the town they are allied to.**

\- How are they supporting the sapped areas from collapsing naturally over the course of the month of preparation time? This isn't minecraft, dirt doesn't just float. Sapping tunnels **need** support beams and planks. Perhaps a small section of their cavern collapses after a few days because of heavy rainfall and they have to spend spell slots rebuilding that part, as well as figuring out some way to better support the layer of dirt above the caverns.

\- How do the players know where the battlefield is? Did the enemy let them choose it? Does it even make sense for the enemy to deploy their army on the location the PCs chose? Would a general deploy his entire force immediately in a world where magic can decimate armies (as once again proven by the players' plan)? Are they hoping the enemy army will encamp on top of their trap? If they chose an area that would be an advantageous position for the invading enemy, good job them. If they just chose a piece of flat land, that's probably a no no.

\- The players could successfully destroy and/or damage a large amount of enemy troops, but there are very obvious drawbacks to this plan. If they are digging around the walls of Fairwind, they are just digging the siege trench for the enemy. After their plan goes off without a hitch, the entire populace might be trapped within Fairwind with no way out until they break the siege, and they just made their enemy's job easier for them.

\- Are they planning to spring the trap when the armies clash? A battle line generally isn't a perfectly straight line, the melee is usually a mess. Have their reinforcements arrived after the enemy army? They're probably not going to be able to spring their trap without taking some of these guys with them. If they remember to warn their allies of the caverns, the allies will probably have a hard time engaging the enemy - either they're worried about falling into the trap, or the trap has already been sprung and the players + city forces have been cut off from their allies.

Finally, try to avoid souring their glory too much. Their plan so far is fine, even if it doesn't instantly kill the army, but there are some aspects that need their attention or it might disappoint or even fail. Don't throw this at them as a ""gotcha"", but give them time to take these problems into account. Maybe have them roll a bunch of int checks. Perhaps an allied NPC who knows of the plan will occasionally pipe up with good solutions (or a mediocre/bad solution, and the players get to figure out what a good solution looks like). Remember that this entire process is taking a month, that's a long time to mull it over for PCs and NPCs alike. Reward the players with success if they plan well and have good solutions, ""punish"" them with disappointment if they don't.",plural_they

"&gt;No, you just ""didn't know"" (conveniently ignored) the fact that the people being sentenced in that exact scene of Chapter 4 were Priests. Not peasants/civilians/commoners or anyone actually innocent of instigating the rebellion.

I'm not talking about that scene in chapter 4. I'm talking about the Lonato mission, where the explicit original goal (prior to being ambushed on the way there) was Rhea ordering the Knights to take the kids on a civilian-executing field trip to teach them what it means to go against the Church. 

&gt;Oh, I see you're trying to move the semantics to ""murders"" captives rather than executing now. I'm afraid that still applies to the Empire, since Edelgard's default is to kill Claude, Flayn, Seteth, &amp; Dimitri. Three of whom could only be spared if Byleth steps in. And especially in Hubert's endings, there are executions, which Edelgard's fully aware of. Even if the act of executing enemies somehow didn't also apply to Edelgard, she already admitted early on that she'd willingly sacrifice the lives of citizens ""just like Lonato"". Literally no matter how much blood flows at her feet. And just like that, we're already done breaking your falsehood.

Nope. The only one of those that is execution is Claude (Seteth, Flayn and Dimitri are all active combatants like any boss you fight and kill on any route), and the default for Claude's captivity is survival, as shown by the event viewer. Execution has a definition, rather than being ""any single death or kill"". If someone is running at me with a knife and I kill them in defence, that isn't an execution. If the police grab them first and after a period of trial+imprisonment they are given the death penalty and a lethal injection, that's an execution. It requires someone be captive and put to death in that order- deaths of active combatants on a battlefield (Seteth, Flayn, Dimitri) aren't execution, while death of captives taken during battle after the battle (only potentially Claude) are. 

&gt;Oh, and technically? Flayn isn't ""leading"" a strike in the Ch. 15 battle. She's defending the eastern section of the map while Knight reinforcements arrive, and judging by the fact that Byleth is the only one who can even consider sparing Flayn or Seteth, killing them is not an example of avoiding execution (considering your own earlier attempt to portray it as ""murder"").

Flayn is attacking. She isn't defending. She's leading the stealth fire attack portion of the Church's *assault* on GM. There is no execution either: she either peaces out mid-battle or dies in battle just like VW/SS Rudolph. 

&gt;And since Edelgard started a war which has caused a 5-year deadlock &amp; the deaths of many across Fodlan, her ""tormenting Fodlan"" isn't a wrong choice of words.

You know what's ""tormented Fodlan"" for longer and for far worse: a millennia of murderous feudalism and caste systems all backing up a false religion set up for the head of said religion to dodge any consequences so she can perform necromancy in peace. Seteth trying to say that Edelgard is tormenting Fodlan, or that time he says she wants to set herself up as a false goddess are all massive projection from him. 

&gt;Dimitri meanwhile doesn't even approve of fighting civilians, only fighting a militia or ""thieves""/bandits because they're actively on a battlefield (see Ch. 3). And we already know that Edelgard never blames another group in front of Dimitri, nor makes any genuine effort to explain, just kept basically saying ""I had nothing to do with that"".

Edelgard literally does blame Thales for Duscur. It's just in-one-ear-out-the-other to Dimitri because he's nuts and has become target-locked on Edelgard. 

&gt;Flame Emperor: There will be no salvation for you and your kind. Those responsible for such gruesome deeds in Duscur and Enbarr.

(Note: this is part of the conversation Dimitri is listening in on)

&gt;It's proof of neglect &amp; isolation; i.e. bad treatment, which was the literal point of imprisonment back in pre-modern times. That is a form of torture, which in the real-word is now known as ""solitary confinement"".

So was Ludwig punished or not? This is what I mean by you constantly shifting position. There's no sign Rhea suffered any worse than Ludwig did over the five years, outside of Edelgard keeping a closer eye on Rhea (which is fair cause, you know, she can turn into a dragon). 

&gt;And besides, how else would Seteth see it, since the crowning was rushed before the tomb incident &amp; without the archbishop there to ceremonially witness it? Seteth effectively had no proof that it wasn't demanded.

Byleth can be right there, and have seen the whole thing. Rather than ask about it, Seteth instantly begins lying about what happened because it's convenient to his narrative.

&gt;And finally; you've still yet to prove that ""execution-happy"" applies to anyone of the major ""lord"" characters more than the others, since that's just their answers to open warfare against them. OR that Ludwig was actually ""shown mercy"" beyond giving a hypothetical discussing degrees of mercy, when no lighter sentence was ever considered by Edelgard.

Feral-Dimitri is obviously the worst regarding executions, where Dimitri's policy is personally-torture-captives-to-death-for-kicks. We don't get a sense of sane-Dimitri's policy, so I'll be generous and assume his magic personality change went to ""no more mass executions"". Claude and Seteth both oversee planned mass execution of helpless prisoners until Berlgiez steps in. WC Rhea sends you on watch-civilians-get-executed trips and has a bunch of people executed without any trial or procedure other than ""I think you should die"". Edelgard only ever potentially executes on person (Claude) with the game assuming you didn't do that if you had the option, guarantees the safety of enemy mooks who surrender en-mass and doesn't have Ludwig executed despite it being entirely within her power to do so (which is a show of mercy, given how she had a range of punishments available for her to inflict, from Dimitri-style 'torture to death like you did to my siblings' to her actual choice of Imprisonment).",generic_singularthey

"Economics 101 (I study Industrial Economics): The supply/demand equilibrium for hospitality workers has shifted upwards because supply of workers has decreased, and the demand for workers has increased. 

Supply has decreased because many EU workers went back to the EU in January. Fewer people want to work customer facing jobs during a pandemic (due to health reasons). And many of the people that the hospitality industry laid of last year retrained and have found secure work in other industries. Amazon for example has poached many hospitality workers and most of them won't return. 

Demand has increased immensely in recent weeks because everything is reopening and those that had a good pandemic have saved loads of money, so they're itching to get to spoons and spend loads of money.

This together = fat pay rises for spoons workers.

"It mainly depends on the prince of the city (assuming it's a camarilla city).  Ckearly you can have some thin bloods going around killing people and embracing willy nilly.  And every prince is going to handle it differently.  

But let's make some assumptions.   Its santa clara.  It's in california.  Ok. So that's a new world city. So the prince is PROBABLY going to be maybe 7th, 8th or 9th generation.  And it's the murder capital, so obviously its poorly ran.  I'd go out on a limb here and say the prince of a city like that may handle it himself.  Just walk right into their have with a couple of his or her favorite bruisers and just ask ""what the hell are you doing?!""  

Rather, I'd like to assume the prince is young and competent. Maybe new to being the prince of the area/city.  He/she sees this new group killing all these people.  So he/she sets some nosferatu and maybe some other to watch them closely.  Maybe for a month or so.  Then, go behind him and gather up every single body they leave before the police find them, embrace every single one of them and give them just enough blood to survive, then at the end of the month confront them on their haven and politely ask them to please stop with all the killing.  Then no matter their response politely and correctly excuse themselves from their haven becasue hey ""I'm a busy prince "" then as they're laughing about what simpleton the prince is, unleash all these hungry and newly embraced undead on them all at once using a semi truck or 2.  If they survive, they can consider it a warning.  If they die then oh well.  They knew better.  If any of the newly embraced survive, then welcome them to the camarilla becasue obviously that person is going to go far in the afterlife and they may be useful later.

"So I got so frustrated last year with the rants of anti-vaxxers I ended up joining a Covid-19 vaccine research study. I didn't know which one I was signing up for, it turned out to the the Johnson &amp; Johnson study.

It was a double blind study, so they had no idea if they were giving me the vaccine or the placebo. I filled out the paperwork, went through a long interview where I filled out even MORE paperwork, sent outside for the nasal swab, sent back inside for a blood draw, then sent to another room where they brought in a box with the number I had been assigned on it. Got the injection, was handed a prepaid debit card (so yes, I get paid for this, I was going to use the money to pay bills but it's such a rigamarole to get that cash I ended up using it to buy a rock tumbler and cosplay stuff instead), and sent home.

I report in on an app every Monday and Thursday as to if I have any symptoms. They sent me home with a digital thermometer, one of those little thingies that takes your pulse that you clip to a finger tip, and an at home Covid swab kit. Every so many months I have to go back in and they take my blood again. And yes, I get paid every time.

Well, the J&amp;J vaccine gets approved, so they call me in because they're going to break the double blind coding. If I had received the placebo they'll give me the vaccine that same day. 

Turns out, I got the vaccine that first day, so I've been vaccinated against Covid-19 since November of last year. No, I didn't really have any side effects other than a sore arm. (That's always the case with my flu shot too, BTW. I never have the fever and all that jazz.)

Since then I managed to finally get my parents (age 78 and 79) to go get their vaccines. They wanted to be vaccinated but they ONLY wanted the Johnson &amp; Johnson since it's just one shot, not two. My mom has had severe allergic reactions to the flu and pneumonia vaccines so she didn't want to risk the two-shot ones even if they're more effective. Found a drive through one where you can make an appointment for a specific vaccine, not a first-come-first-serve sort of thing. So they've gotten their J&amp;J C19 shots too and are very happy about it. 

Mom, surprisingly, didn't have a reaction to her's. Dad got very sick the next day and I thought I'd actually have to finally use the special leave we have at work just for Covid-19 related things. But I went to work and he spent the entire day in bed.

"&gt;As far as RAW is concerned, for combat purposes, each of your hands fit exactly one weapon.

This just isn't true. If you're going to argue RAW then show your working. Give me a quote and a page number. You seem to be imagining all this headcanon of specificity that just doesn't exist in the books. Here's what page 144 of the PHB has to say about Shields. ""Shields. A shield is made from wood or metal andis carried in one hand. Wielding a shield increases your Armor Class by 2. You can benefit from only one shield at a time."" the distinction between ""Carried in one hand"" and ""You may only carry one weapon in each hand"" is a flight of fancy that happened entirely within your mind.

&gt;RAW allows you to use your single ""free object interaction"" to draw a weapon as part of an Attack action. That's one draw per action, not one draw per attack in the ""flurry"" granted to you by Extra Attack (#).

That's cool, but drawing and stowing weapons from your pack or a scabbard or whatever has exactly zero bearing on your ability to hold things in your hands.

&gt;Hell, RAW doesn't even let you put anything in your shield hands.

Again, completely untrue, show your working. Give me a quote and a page number. Let's take a look at the Feat War Caster, that notably allows you to operate a spellcasting focus while holding a Sword and Shield so you can cast spells. On Page 170 of the PHB War Caster says ""You can perform the somatic components of spells even when you have weapons or a shield in one or both hands."" Now is there something we should be noticing about that wording? It tells us we need War Caster to ""Perform Somatic Components"" but makes absolutely no mention at all of holding or carrying a Spellcasting Focus. Now this of course logically follows to mean only one of two possible options:

1. You cannot cast a spell as a Sword and Board combatant without dropping your Weapon or Shield even ***with*** War Caster, as since you cannot carry your Focus at the same time as using your Sword and Shield your newfound ability to perform Somatic Components is worthless and you are gated by the same limitations as anyone else.
2. You do not need to have the War Caster feat to ***hold or carry*** a Spellcasting Focus as a Sword and Board Combatant, you just need it to ***Perform Somatic Components.*** I.e ***Use*** the object you are holding.If you're going to make arguments from RAW, they entirely support my argument.

&gt;Somehow 5E's shields are both strapped to the forearm (they take a roundto don / doff) and held (they fill your hand and prevent its use forother purposes). Bizarre.

Not so bizarre, while there are shields used by holding a bar or other handhold and shields strapped to the arm, most shields strapped to the arm are also held in the hand too while used. It looks like [This](https://www.worldhistory.org/img/c/p/1200x627/152.jpg).  This particular Hoplon has a rope to hold, but that's just one way of doing it many shields have wooden or metal bars to hold onto. You don't tend to see shields that are merely strapped to the arm and not also simultaneously held, an example of an exception being the Macedonian [Phalangite](https://hetairoi.de/sites/default/files/styles/fluff_image_large/public/2017-02/20150802_15-03-08_DSCN8737.jpg?itok=KV4DyzeJ) who strap a small shield called a Pelta to their arm and just let it sit on the forearm while they operate their Pikes with both hands. This is why you cannot ***use*** another object or weapon while holding and operating your sheild.

However shields prevent you from performing actions with other things while holding them, such as casting a spell (Without War Caster) or making a weapon attack. There is nothing stopping you from just holding something, observe this [Peltast](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Agrianian3.jpg) doing so. Note that he is still holding and operating the shield with his hand and not metely letting it hang off his arm from the strap like a Phalangite would. This is what the difference between ***holding*** an object, and ***using*** an object looks like. The Phalangite is ***holding*** their Shield and ***using*** their pike. While the Peltast is ***holding*** their Javelins and ***using*** their Shield.",plural_they

"When I hiked Green Mountain here in WA last yr they were doing train maintenance using horses (and one llama) to haul big sterilite bins of gear up. This was in addition to folks carrying fully loaded packs. I can't imagine doing a **hike** hike with anything more than what I'm comfortable carrying on my back, just for safety and comfort reasons.

I do festivals yearly, one of which requires a walk-in of about 3\~ miles across some small hills. For that I bought a [garden cart](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006P5JHO4/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1), rigged a big piece of plywood to it for a base, then strapped all my gear to that. It hauls my 60lb dome tent, four big camp chairs, table and kitchen, cot, a bunch of electrical gear, etc gear just fine. I wouldn't advise this on any trails narrower than a standard road though, since it can be tough to maneuver and you wouldn't want to ruin other peoples trips by taking up the whole path.

If you're not doing any major elevation, are on wide, mostly flat or rolling paths, and don't need to get there in any big hurry a garden cart like the one I linked could be a good option.As for attaching it to your body - I tried this with a chest harness fixed to the cart handle. I do not advise it. It works great going uphill or flat, but even a slight dip in the path sends the whole heavy cart slamming into your back and legs handle-first, which is a big safety concern on top of being really annoying. I've found the best alternative is to feed a solid pole thru the handle to widen your grip a little, while still keeping your connection to the handle solid in case you need to brace downhill.",

"But that's literally all the depth that the champion has. There was this EUW Challenger Shen OTP (xPetu or something) who plays with locked camera. Is this the map awareness needed to operate? You just need to look at your team's health bar and press the correct F-key if you see it falling down and then just click R while hovering your mouse over the correct portrait. That's literally your entire gameplay. You need a base level understanding of what all the champions do so you can deduce if it's a good idea to old and that's it.

About the win condition - it's more often than not either the mid or ADC. Not fucking rocket science. 

The build depends on how confident are you in your team's ability to carry you.

How to play Shen 101:

Start Q, walk up, press Q, auto the enemy, win the trade.

Get level 2, miss E, press Q, miss it, auto the enemy, win the trade.

Get level 3, miss E, press Q, miss it, fail to block their autos with W, ignite them, nice, now you have free kill. Recall, buy Bramble, now you can't die.

Get level 6, while continuing trading with your opponent. If you notice that any health bar is going down press the respective F-key and decide whether to R or not. Get 300 assist gold. Go back to lane with your newly bought Bami's.

"The scientific term for black pilled is ?entity theorist?

 According to the Entity Theory, intelligence is a personal quality that is fixed and cannot be changed.

Entity Theorists believe that even if people can learn new things their intelligence stays the same.  They will likely blame their intelligence and abilities for achievement failures. 

   According to the Incremental Theory, on the other hand, intelligence is not fixed and can be improved through enough effort. 

Incremental Theorists will blame lack of effort and/or strategy use that are possible to mediate negative outcomes. They will likely act out and improve the situations with more effort. 

    Holding either of these theories has important consequences for people.  Studies have shown that entity theorists of intelligence react helplessly in negative outcomes. ""That is, they are not only more likely to make negative judgments about their intelligence from failures, but also more likely to show negative affect and debilitation. In contrast, incremental theorists, who focus more on behavioral factors (e.g., effort, problem-solving strategies) as causes of negative achievement outcomes, tend to act on these mediators (e.g., to try harder, develop better strategies) and to continue to work towards mastery of the task"" (Dweck, Chiu, &amp; Hong, 1995, p. 268). 

     In their studies, Dweck, Bandura, and Leggett assessed students'  theories of intelligence and found out that students who were holding an entity theory of intelligence chose the performance goals tasks more than those holding an incremental theory of intelligence when they were given options to choose between the tasks that represented performance goals and learning goals (cited in Dweck, Chiu, &amp; Hong, 1995, p.274).

&gt;That no one has said there is no way to tell if someone is male or female unless you ask them how they identify?

Sex and gender are separate things. Biological sex is not gender. Since people identify as a gender this has no implication that men and women are biologically the same because it makes no indication about sex.

&gt;Are you saying that no one has ever said that sex organs don?t indicate gender?

Sex organs can indicate gender but they don't define it. The majority of people's gender does align with the sex organs. Again, gender and sex are different things

&gt; Are you saying that no one has ever made the argument that bio sex and gender identity are not related

They are not the same thing. They are certainly related, but not the same thing. I'm confused as to how saying that gender and sex are not the same somehow means that men=women

&gt; the existence of intersex people and people with an extra x or Y chromosome proves that the concept of ?biological sex? is somehow either not real, not correlated with either genotype or phenotype? 

Again, I'm confused about the point you are trying to make.

"I really enjoyed this story. It's probably the most well-written piece I have ever read on this subreddit, the prose is excellent, and I loved your narrative voice. The writing has style and uses metaphors and technique brilliantly. I really loved the following lines:

'recently cleaned ashtray', 'menace to mannequin', 'squinting as if he were inspecting a dollar bill for signs of forgery', 'eventually I finished eating him, but curiosity had only begun eating away at me'.

They are unique and brilliantly immersive descriptions - certainly a highlight of the writing is how you paint a picture.

I have made a few line edits as AB, but most of them are just personal perspectives on what would read easier. On the main, I didn't trip up over any of the syntax, and the majority of your sentences flowed well. It read as if there were far fewer words than 5,647, which is always a good sign.

In terms of critique, I would say this short story is strongly led by dialogue, which isn't a bad thing. Character is expressed well through this dialogue, although I was confused as to Peter's voice. In one instance, he uses the casual 'ain't got nothing to do with God' , but he otherwise comes across as fairly well spoken except for this. I understand he was raised on a farm, so it makes sense that lines like this might slip out. But given Kirk speaks in a (what I assume is Texan or something) accent, it would be a good contrast between the characters if Peter hides his past (his accent), whereas Kirk is honest about who he is.

I would also say that Kirk's confession is giving me wall of text at times,  and would read easier if it were broken up with more action beats, or responses from Peter. Page 8, for example, is all dialogue. If this were a passage of a larger story, it wouldn't raise any eyebrows from me, but it's easier to lose attention in a short story, and I did find myself skimming through it.

Some notes I made while reading:

I like how the priest goes by his first name and the prisoner by his second - think this a good insight into their characters.

I found Kirk's descriptions of how his murder victims look incredibly harrowing and beautifully put.

The metaphor about Kirk standing at attention when the penis man stepped towards him made me laugh.

Anyway, my concluding critique is that the ending, for me, was the weakest part of the entire story.

I thought the reveal about Peter having raped Kirk was heavy handed and rushed. Perhaps I'm just dim, but I didn't pick up on any foreshadowing for this reveal, or the suggestion that a previous relationship existed between the two men (although if there was, please let me know as I would be interested to know how you imbedded this). Reading back, I wonder if 'concealing his wince as if it were an unexpected erection' was written to serve this purpose? The reveal would be hugely improved if there was a suggestion of history between the two men before (there is mention of building that 'first bit of rapport', which is confusing once you know they are familiar with other), or if you had implied the priest's reaction to the prisoner was founded on more than fear, or if we had further backstory on the priest (the suggestion he is a paedo). For example, when Kirk puts his hand on Peter's knee, perhaps Peter could do something other than just jump.

In general, the ending could be much better. Your voice and the flow of the story didn't come across as well in the final page, and the final line meant nothing to me. October had come? What is the significance of this?  I would revise the final page if I were you so that we can see more of the priest's reaction and what happens to Kirk. I was expecting that Peter would respond to the accusation from Kirk by breaking his vegetarian pact and eating the pork, or to otherwise react more interestingly than by just curling up in a ball.

To answer your questions:

1. Didn't stop reading. As noted above, I skimmed through the areas where the dialogue was blocky. That said, I was hooked enough by the story to read through it again properly afterwards
2. Disagree with this. The prison scene is primary focused on Kirk and his confession. So the first page is a good opportunity to develop Peter's character - if anything, I would make it longer, and characterise George's role in the story, as he appears in the final scene.  When George says, 'To think, what that devil could have done to an old man like you' I took this as a wink at the moral of the story - that the priest has kickstarted Kirk's problems, and yet receives no repercussions for it. So if George is aware of the priest's backstory (and we learn more about their relationship), I think the moral would be strengthened.
3. Nope, thought priest was fine. As I say, could be characterised better and of course raping children is a stereotype, but the strength of your writing didn't make this a problem for me.
4. Didn't guess what would happen. Which, for me, was a bad thing.
5. Sure thing
6. For sure. I couldn't find any syntax errors and everything else reads brilliantly. Think it would be worth a shot submitting, though your ending can be much better. (Also, as a side note, is the story set in the WoW world? I googled Auberdine to see where it is and noted it's a location in WoW.

My simple answer is if your switching you can play any games just dont get your hopes up about ones with anticheats and remember to download lutris it makes everything very easy and i would go would pop os cosmic as it looks nice and has some of the best support for gaming and also get zanmod kernal for a little bit more of a boost in gaming.",mixed_they

"I think a lot of the reason people hear mostly complaints about having kids is that the people who are happy about having kids don't have as many complaints to share. They don't have a list of grievances they feel they need to air out to avoid exploding. So of course you don't hear as much from the happy ones.

Like in my department there's this one lady that's always complaining about her longtime boyfriend's 3 unruly boys. But of the 21 people in the department, only 4 don't have kids.

So of the 17 people with kids, only 1 is constantly complaining and the other 16 have nothing to add. *But of course the one speaking is the noticable one*.

Anyway, I always recommend against having kids, because people should be so certain they want kids that my recommendation doesn't stop them.

Encourage them to seek help, but know that it may take a a lot their part to take that first step. Also: You can't rescue your loved one by yourself. It's really hard and you might have to prioritize saving yourself. Depression can remove all motivation, making it hard to eat, shower or seek help.

If that doesn't start working after a few months, or you don't think you have any issues to talk about, or you already tried a therapist, then find a psychiatrist (that's someone that will give you pills to solve the issue).

Some people will be depressed, but don't know why. A common reason is that they don't have a purpose in life. To live is to suffer, but it is possible to make that suffering bearable, if you do so while trying to achieve what you want more than anything else.

What this means differs from person to person, depending on their music taste. I have a special playlist for this. One way to measure the effectiveness, of the songs is your ability to listen to it over and over (if you can listen to it hundreds of times it likely has the highest positive effect on your mood). The effect can be amplified by using headphones and playing it LOUD and can further be enhanced by closing your eyes.
* **You are not your depression**: For some, their depression has become a part of who they are and they assume a victim role.

As Eckhart Tolle wrote:
* &gt; *A very common role is the one of victim, and the form of attention it seeks is sympathy or pity or others' interest in my problems, ""me and my story."" Seeing oneself as a victim is an element in many egoic patterns, such as complaining, being offended, outraged, and so on. Of course, once I am identified with a story in which I assigned myself the role of victim, I don't want it to end, and so, as every therapist knows, the ego does not want an end to its ""problems"" because they are part of its identity.*
* **Practice gratitude**: Take 5 minutes every day [to practice gratitude.](https://www.pasadenavilla.com/2020/11/18/gratitude-and-depression)

"It's not a matter of delaying botw 2, it's staying on track for their planned release schedule or at least their modified schedule after covid interference. I am not saying they will delay botw2 *because of SSHD*, I am saying they are strategically releasing SSHD before both to maximize it's sales potential while also ensuring they don't rush Botw2 out the window. It's a combination of holding Zelda fans over and ensuring botw 2 is up to snuff. If they thought holding off on Zelda for another year meant a better game and better experience they would delay it in a heartbeat. Maybe they are at that crossroad, or maybe they just needed another few months for polish.

If the Botw sequel is on par let alone bigger than the first, it's going to be the Zelda focus for a couple years. It will presumably be the only Zelda interest for a year or two, maybe longer, so it makes way more sense to drop SSHD prior to the BotW 2 instead of sitting on it for another 3 years. And even though SSHD isn't going to be smash hit like Botw or it's sequel, you are the dumb one for thinking Nintendo won't still milk it for everything they can and strategically release it when they think itcan best perform.",mixed_they

I'm not necessarily sure we blame them, but we do punish them for exceeding what is appropriate in society.

This is one of those problems we haven't fully understood or figured out. How do we weigh punishing people compelled to act by trauma with the safety of others who are experiencing a ""normal life?"" Ultimately, more ""normal lives"" can persist when we punish people who commit violence, not because they wanted to, but because they were conditioned or compelled to.

"Fraid not. I'm honestly not trying to be disrespectful here but the super straight movement was born out of transphobia (that guy on tiktok saying he wanted a ""real woman"" thereby implying that trans women aren't ""real women"") and while I admit that I might be prejudiced and/or biased being trans myself, super straights aren't a part of the LGBTQ+ community, which is what pride month is all about.

I'll try to clarify: most people who identify as super straight seem to have a genital preference, want biological children or just be downright transphobic. Ignoring the transphobes, SS isn't really a sexuality at all, it's just being uncomfortable with dating someone with a penis or vagina if that's what you have. A lot of people have been tugged along on the movement because they thought ""hey, I'm a dude who doesn't want to date a girl with a dick so I must be super straight!"" They either don't realise that identifying as such is actually transphobic or just don't care.

This comment has kind of gotten a bit off-topic and I hope this doesn't come off as demanding but I'd advise you to have a bit of a think about why you identify as super straight. If it's a genital preference or a desire to have children you're not transphobic (hopefully) but you might want to stop identifying as super straight.

To summarise, super straight is generally either a genital preference, a want for biological children, a mix of both or transphobia. None of this makes it a part of the LGBTQ+ community and no super straight person has ever been discriminated against\* so they don't even need pride.

Please feel free to ask me any questions, by the way, and I hope this helped! :)

\*Superstraightphobia does not exist. I'm trying to be as respectful as I can but what a lot of super straight people consider superstraightphobia is just others, be they cishet or a part of the LGBTQ+ community, making fun of its origin and how many super straights have no idea why they're being called transphobic when ""it's just a preference"".",plural_they
"In general, the courts are not going to compare some nominal value between the consideration you receive and the consideration your employer receives. So long as the consideration is not so trivial as to be meaningless, whether it's ""worth it"" or not is a negotiation question that only you can answer.

Other than as restricted by a union agreement or by specific language in your employment contract, in BC your employer can _already_ lay you off, pretty much at will, provided they comply with the province's rules around notice and severance. In many cases, you may be entitled to more than the statutory amounts, as well. A contract affirming that right may limit your common-law entitlements, but doesn't affect your statutory ones.

&gt; What happens when there is a disagreement between myself as acceptable considerations versus what the employer thinks is acceptable?

If you and your employer can't come to a consensus on the terms of your employment going forwards, then what happens next depends on whether your existing agreement prevents them from terminating you, and whether they're willing to allow you to continue under your current terms. The most likely outcome if you refuse the new terms is a no-fault termination of your employment.",specific_unknown_singularthey

"Such hyperbole. As though anyone needs a DNA test to accurately recognise someone's sex. Would you believe that evolution has done a remarkable job of developing us into a species that can instantly recognise the sex of other members of our species?

A thought: either gender means the sex we objectively are, or it means the costumes we wear atop the sex we objectively are.

If the former, then sex and gender are synonymous. If the latter, then gender is little more than superficial appearance and can be disregarded when it comes to sex-based rights and realities. 

You seem to agree that 'gender' is a social construct, which it certainly, demonstrably is. I'd go so far as to say that it is fundamentally toxic because it implies that there are certain ways that men have to look, behave, and present themselves to be 'men', and similarly that there are certain ways that women have to look, behave, and present themselves to be 'women'. 

I reject gender entirely. I am a man because it's what I objectively am. It's self-evident and stands up to scrutiny, criticism and requires zero belief, affirmation or societal participation for it to be true. I can be as feminine as I like, or as masculine as I like, I remain a man. You could subjectively believe me a woman and I'd still be a man.

The only 'conflation' I see between 'gender' and 'sex', especially where trans people are concerned, is that to truly be as they 'feel' inside, they need to adopt the stereotypical traits (appearance, behaviour, presentation) of the opposite sex, going so far as to adopt their secondary sex characteristics (breasts or the lack thereof, an approximation of a penis or the lack thereof, hair growth or the lack thereof). 

You don't, on some level, find it strange that there's a group of people who believe that to be their 'authentic' selves, they need to 'identify', look, act and behave as what is patently obvious to all and sundry a social construct?

Or, for that matter, that children can in any way be slotted into that social construct and set upon a path of lifetime medication and surgery to fit into sexist 'gender' roles when they haven't even reached puberty yet (puberty blocker proponents, anyone?) and thus cannot possibly understand or appreciate the realities of sex, sexual maturity and the inevitable hormonal changes therein? 

Who truly makes that decision for those children? I can guarantee, it's not the kids. Kids who believe in Santa; who believe in gods and monsters, because they trust adults and believe in what adults convince them of themselves and others.

You would think that the healthiest thing for trans people would be to simply be as they are--as feminine or masculine as they like, and rightly accepted as such. Without lies, deception, or affirmation. 

I also find your comparison of biological/adoptive parenthood ridiculous. The concept of parenthood in terms of nurture and care for a child is not analogous to sex and sexual intimacy. 

Regardless, semantically, again, everyone involved in that relationship (unless kept in the dark) would be aware of what their role and any biological relationship to each other would be. 

Reality is reality. Honesty is honesty. Fact is fact. The route to being happy and content with your existence is learning to accept yourself and what you are. Again, take that from a gay guy who grew up in a conservative environment. Lying to myself would have never allowed me to come to terms with my reality and what I objectively am. 

It also made me fully aware that society is not beholden to me, nor am I beholden to society--I am what I am and I don't require societal participation to get on with my life or to be what I am.

Trans people need a great deal of support. What they don't need is people lying to them. Affirmation is a lie. Affirming the lie that that actual straight people will ever want to be with someone who is the same sex is harmful. Affirming the lie that actual gay people will ever want to be with someone who is the opposite sex is harmful. 

And, certainly, perpetuating the lie that anyone who criticises transgenderism, gender theory, or its effects on women and same-sex attracted people are 'transphobes' leaves you in a rather awkward position in which you stifle debate, censor the reality of others, and con trans people into the belief that the world outside hates them when, really, it doesn't. 

It's remarkable how easy it is to cope in life when you realise that we are all different, and we each need different kinds of support in life. But the more we lie to ourselves, and the more society participates in that lie, the longer it takes us to get that support and learn to cope in life.

"You also realize that the landlord doesn't *own* the home either. He is *renting* it from the bank. They agreed to loan him hundreds of thousands of dollars to buy the home and in exchange he agreed to pay a monthly sum for that service. In addition, he is also renting the house he doesn't even own yet from the government. And if they don't get their cut for the rest of eternity, at an ever increasing rate based on an entirely arbitrary rubric, they will then seize that object that the landlord has been paying on for years or decades, with no compensation for all the back payments made.

"Thanks again for sharing this. I've now solved it. A few comments:

* It should be clearly specified that the floor can be tiled ""horizontally"". Otherwise solutions involving some combination of vertical and horizontal boards might be considered.

* It would be great to specify lengths and heights in mm to avoid that pesky 22.5 that might encourage people to use floating point, which could lead them to issues.

* I solved this with a fancy two-level depth-first search in 177 lines of Rust in about 80ms on my machine. Was this level of fanciness intended?

* With the board lengths as given, a maximally greedy tiling works fine ? no search needed. My solution was

        90 90 8 8 
        90 90 8 8 
        90 90 8 8 
        90 90 8 8 
        90 90 8 8 
        45 45 45 45 8 8 
        45 45 45 45 8 8 
        45 45 22.5 22.5 22.5 22.5 8 8 
        22.5 22.5 22.5 22.5 22.5 22.5 22.5 22.5 8 8 
        22.5 22.5 22.5 22.5 22.5 22.5 22.5 22.5 8 8 

  I wish I had written this in the first place. Either need to find more interesting board lengths or give a hint that search is not needed.

* Not sure about the graphic representation with this row size. 196+ columns is a lot for an ASCII display, and I'm not sure it adds much to the problem.

* Not sure about the bonus problem. My search would easily allow shuffling the rows and their contents each time, which is kind of boring. Maybe specify better what is meant by ""a different solution"" to make it interesting. Seems hard.

* One constraint that would make the problem harder is ""lapped joints"": no two adjacent rows can have a board break in the same spot. This is fairly realistic for hardwood flooring. Is this what was intended?

I think people get so concerned with prioritizing the preexisting relationship that they aren?t going into polyamory with good boundaries about their independence, and a lot of people feel like they have to get their partners permission first (I am not saying you should unilaterally decide to be poly overnight and just cheat on your partner, but if you don?t agree about being polyamorous, you need personal boundaries about no longer agreeing to monogamous contracts, and if they choose to leave, they leave). It seems like the people that want poly but want to do every step ?with? their up till now monogamous partner just have a really hard time.",specific_unknown_singularthey
"They would make maximum profit on an autoswitching value based pool.  Because RandomX is really too difficult for them and requires too much RAM (and fast stuff like DDR4-3200+ on a wide bus).  So by leveraging the fact it's much more efficient at smaller algos it might make some XMR through autoexchange by processing cn-lite or such instead.

I run a terrible Atom D2550 with 1MB of cache and 4GB of memory (just barely enough for RandomX to not be in light mode which is 10x slower) and that scores 74.6H/s with rx/0 but with MoneroOcean it mines panthera algo at 172.6H/s which pays out equivalent to 132.7H/s (earns almost double what it would if it was doing real rx/0-for-XMR mining on actual Monero Blockchain).

"Will it take away from the players?

There's a definite threat of that, but it's not guaranteed.  If you're aware of it and planning accordingly, you can make it be done well.

In my current campaign, I have a large number of powerful noble houses with many heroes on their roster, as well as powerful factions having grand conspiracies to manipulated those nobles into doing their biddings.  The result is that, especially at level one, the PCs were really small fish in a huge pond.  It's gone well, and players seem to be enjoying it enough that we've played weekly for a full year and everyone's up to level 15 now - so it's doable.  

At low levels, I generally had most nobles view them as a useful and unknown agent.  Perfect for black ops that they didn't want to take credit for.  One Duke was considering rebelling, but his holding is dependent on water from a river.  A rival noble had a dam up river which he could close at any time.  So the PCs were perfect for a sabotage mission: unknown, not affiliated with him, and expendable should they fail.  

Later, when that duke did rebel, a number of his loyal men in the king's army were taken captive.  So the PCs met with leaders of the neighboring nation the king was trying to conquer and coordinated.  Then when the enemy army showed up to give battle, the PCs snuck in to do a prison break while the camp was mostly emptied out.  Then they used those forces to liberate a city the king had conquered, making an alliance between the Duke and the king's enemies in the process.  For this task, the players talked their way in through the gate, made contact with local resistance group, then took out the gate guards and opened it to let their rescued army in.  Then while their army fought the garrisoned forces, they went to the headquarters building to confront the leaders and prevent any coordination of defense.

You'll note that during this the main theme of it was the political heavy civil war among noble houses.  These battles are decided by clashes between huge armies, in which the players are realistically only a few out of thousands.  Yet the story we're telling is really centered on the PCs, and their involvement in it.  That same stuff could have been the a duke rebelled, and his men left their king's camp to go back-cap the stuff he'd just conquered.  But now the duke rebelled because the players removed the dam that tied his hands; his men conquered a city because they rescued them (and hail them as the heroes that led them from execution at the hands of a tyrant king to being proud liberators of new allies).

There are definitely major things that these various NPC noble houses and factions do off-camera, especially the enemies and rivals, but many of these deeds are painted as a reaction to what the PCs have done. This makes the world feel real and reactive, while also reminding the players they aren't the powers that be are beating up on a static world full of unchanged NPCs.  And they delight in having some of those NPCs get angry over their exploits.  

At level 1, these all felt like insurmountable odds and great things beyond them.  At level 15, they feel more like Gandalf declaring that he'll fight the balrog while everyone else deals with the lowbie goblins.  That gives a really cool sense of progression for them.

So if you'll forgive me taking an excuse to talk about my campaign, I'd say it's definitely doable and if done right can be very enjoyable.  And since you're already considering the pitfalls rather than just running ahead without a second thought, I suspect you'll do well with it!",plural_they

"The difference between medicine and a drug is the dose edit: moreso the circumstances. There are historical and even popular contemporary uses for drugs in pharmaceutical medicine including methamphetamine (adderal), cocaine (used as a local anesthetic), opium (oxycodone and others), etc. The raw forms of these are illegal for non scientist citizens to possess because of the war on drugs which funneled the raw forms of the drugs into lower income neighborhoods to increase addiction and poverty rates, thus lowering the social mobility of the residents. This is still going on. By retaining control and patents on these drugs they can keep anyone from working on them. And your taxes paid for those patents/research jsyk. Purdue pharma was just caught over-prescribing opioids to their patients for money, this increased addiction rates among those patients, leading to an increased use of heroin particularly in manual labor work in rural and low income communities. Drugs like meth, coke, heroin, benzos, etc. are most used to prevent pain and keep people at work.

On the other hand, things like mdma, lsd, magic mushrooms,marijuana, face stigma from the war on drugs, saying they lead to lunacy, depression, etc. When in reality these drugs have shown the most potential for assisting in psychological healing. This commonly correlates with decreased efforts in the work force because people realize they are being overworked and they don't care about money, therefore research for these drugs is not done by pharmaceutical companies as it doesn't suit their needs. It is passed off as being illegal to do research with these drugs, yet they are able to do research with things like cocaine and opium.

"&gt;Yeah, but they did get a bit more relief for the working class in 3 months than the Republicans in 4 years.

Who's they? The Dems sent me $1400, the GOP sent me $2600, if you're going to try to look at it that way.  And neither of those are ""relief"" that's barely a fucking bandaid on the bleeding gut shot that Capitalism has put on the working class. 

Neither half of the War Party wants to see wages raised, landlords restricted, rents controlled, or income inequality addressed. Because their bosses on Wall St know any of those things are actually bad for their bottom line, as opposed to the aesthetics-only policies the Dems pursue that actually help corporate profits while pretendong they benefit the people, case in point: the ACA was a bonanza for insurance companies, reined in benefit costs for the fortune 500, and did fuck-all to help the working poor, who now had to buy the insurance they couldn't afford before, at basically the same prices.

&gt;Right now, they are budgeting Universal Daycare -- which is HUGE for some working poor families.

Some.

This is actually a way to subsidize the businesses that should have been providing child care all along. If this were really to help working people it would be a cash payout so that people without kids could benefit too. This is just a way to get the serfs to work more for less, because now they don't have to pay child care, so they don't need as much to survive.

&gt;The Democrats might be working for the Oligarchy -- but they are costing it more.

No, they're providing it benefits and saying they're benefits for the working class. Everything a Dem has done since the Great Society programs has been for Wall St. Sometimes they put enough window dressing on it that the working class gets some of them crumbs.

&gt;Do I need to trot out the actual difference in policies proposed and voted for by Congress between Dems and Republicans?

Please do. I'm bored at work today, and a class analysis of whatever policy you bring will amuse me, and hopefully enlighten anyone else following along. But remember that just saying it helps the working class doesn't actually count. It has to actually increase the power of the working class relative to the bosses and landlords or it's just aesthetics.

"Oof, you completely miss the logic on the condition. 

Imagine there was some magical objective measure of 0 to 100 that scored a card?s condition. Now PSA will grade anything with this magic score of 90 or above with a perfect ?10?, BGS is way more strict and requires a score of 95. Way less cards meet the criteria of 95 then 90. Around the same number of alpha lotuses are graded by both companies (this is true even outside of this theoretical ). Of the cards submitted to each company 14 of them have an objective quality of 90 or higher. 7 to each company. The PSA ones have objective scores of 90,90,90,92,94, 97, 99 , while the BGS has scores of 90,90,90,93,94,94,96. 

So PSA ends up with 7 ?10? cards, and BGS ends up with 1 ?10? card, however two of the PSA cards are in better condition than the one BGS ?10? is. 

Now do you see why even though PSA has less strict requirements for a 10, it doesn?t necessarily mean that the BGS card is of higher quality then the best of the PSA cards? PSA doesn?t have an 11, a card better than the BGS 10 would still just get a 10. And BGS does have subgrades, which the existing 10 lotus does not have perfect of. 

And no it is not ?well know in the community that it?s worth far more than a million? as it?s never sold for that much.

"Honestly, the TOS Enterprise is preposterously small according to its scale. The neck is literally a car length... 

As for the bridge window, you often see the ""why would you put a window on the most vulnerable part of the ship? That's just asking to get everyone killed. A couple issues there:

1.) This is assuming that the Enterprise is purely a warship, which you honestly should explicitly not do. It's an exploration ship. Many modern day oceanic and space exploration vessels HAVE BIG VIEWPORTS. Our spacecraft have cockpit viewports, literally every fighter jet has a huge canopy, and our explorational submarines have massive canopy domes. And while most military submarines do not have huge bridge windows, most surface naval vessels do! In fact many bridges are ALL WINDOW. Bridge windows are a common real life thing on actual military craft for the explicit reason that you can see out of the ship without relying on just instrumentation. We do this today. You don't think 300 years from now we'd have durable enough materials to make it safe? The bridge is already placed in a very vulnerable position. Why have it there if everything can be done with sensors and screens?

Having things like a battle bridge or the Defiant bridge be entirely windowless makes sense. But putting the bridge in the most vulnerable spot in the ship, with a window dome over their heads, but not giving them a way to see outside is actually inviting issues anytime sensors are inoperable or a nebula causes ""static"" like in Wrath of Khan. A power failure to the viewscreen would leave the bridge entirely reliant on instrumentation. Also the nature of the Trek cloaking device somewhat implies the use of visual searching to view starships, otherwise they could simply use stealth tech like in some other franchises.

2.) Trek already has windows on the bridge. Several vessels in older Trek canon including the original Enterprise and the D have large domes of windows directly over the heads of the crew, which is an even more vulnerable angle. Generations even has these windows shatter. Also, there are windows littered all over the hull in most living quarters and large meeting rooms. Also most sci-fi franchises have bridge windows...",plural_they

"Neat idea. I think there might be room to think about the design of marks from a writing POV. If you look at human scripts, like Latin alphabet, or CJK logographs, there are distinctions which mean great variety of styling and variety is possible without compromising legibility. In designing written-style marks, it might be good to find the essential ""character"" of the mark, and also think about the mechanics of how they will be drawn. E.g. I, XV, XIV, XII, VIII, XVIII seem simple, but IX, X, VI, XVII, start to get a bit more complex and detailed on proportion and numbers of loops/zigzags.

I actually visualise Charter marks as written inside circles, just like the [ATLA symbol of water](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/06/e1/0e/06e10ece340cecd58239edb780ef28ad.jpg), maybe even the [Bionicle script](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e3/7a/93/e37a93e6c89cba64b2271d34f3134489.png)!

"I do have students who will abuse this (elementary kids!) But I'm very careful about choosing to say no. First of all, if possible, they can go. But sometimes there's restrictions, like sometimes an adult HAS to walk them to the bathroom and back and no one is able to at that moment.
Second, if I tell them no, it's usually with a reason ""the whole group is doing a bathroom break soon, I need you to hear my announcement right now, there's no staff who can take you right now, etc"" and with a time frame ""can you wait 2 minutes/10 minutes/ 30 minutes""

But if they're in a stall, I assume they are either using the restroom or taking a mental break and need the time and a verbal ""I'm fine"" or ""I don't need anything"" is all I need to return to the group.

I've only needed to circle back to the bathroom for the same kid more than once one time. She was in the stall for 20+ minutes, and just so happened to walk out as I came by to check on her again. I could clearly see she'd been crying. I immediately told her to take a few more minutes, wash her face, and offered to take her for a walk around campus if she wanted some alone time with me (which is always a standing invitation when I'm able to; but I wanted to remind her at that moment). She declined the walk, cleaned up, returned to the group... A half hour later, she asked for the walk... Turns out she had some heavy stuff on her shoulders and her peers weren't understanding (not bullying her, but no one could make her feel heard, despite their efforts). We ended up taking walks a few times a week. Sometimes she wanted a friend to go too, so I could help her explain herself to them.",plural_they

I will also have the ability to move cash to a card for repayment by then as well. I just have a purchase I am trying to make this evening without cash on my card to do so.

"Oh I agree with you to some extent, I think PC players should be able to choose to play with MKB players only just like console players get to choose to play with controller/console players only (Aside from XIM/Cronus users who use MKB undetected). 

The problem is the issue is one sided... MKB gets no choice but controller does. You can use a controller on PC or console but only MKB on PC, and you can choose not to play in pc lobbies if you are on console. When you play on PC you have no choice to be in crossplay lobbies, and you have no choice if your pc brethren use a controller. Seems unfair to me that MKB even if it does have some advantages is pitted against someone with any advantage and vice versa... Also cqc there is no debate on the advantage and most fights take place close in Apex, or you can quickly make them close. I personally prefer that gaming be equal playing field. I want to play against MKB users only.

Warzone, although not a fan of the game allows you to opt out of crossplay on PC, which doesn't entirely eliminate controller players from the pool, I would assume it would lessen the amount. There shouldn't be an advantage for anyone in BR, no matter what. 

So I don't think MKB users want to be superior, they just want to be equal or at least in my opinion. I think crossplay is great feature, but Apex needs to let PC opt out of it. As a side note you can reload in front of doors with controller but you have to change your reload button/use button and make one hold and one tap... I used to play Apex on console before switching to PC so I know what playing with a controller is like in Apex.",plural_they

Re: Grojsman Accord

  
The magic of this accord, and the reason it is incorporated into so many modern fragrances, is its versatility: both in terms of the range of other things it will work with and the variations upon it that are possible. I've certainly had success with many different proportions and with Timbersilk instead of IES, isoraldiene 95 in place of plain Methyl Ionone, Romandolide in place of Galaxolide and Hedione HC in place of plain Hedione.   
Substitute them all, use radically different proportions and yet the accord can still be recognised: that was her genius in putting it together as well as the magic of the ingredients themselves.  
In the past, a more or less universal accord consisted of a musk (or ambergris, which can be looked at as a musk), a wood (formerly real sandalwood), and something jasminy and/or rosy (often, the natural absolutes, but also whatever synthetics became available) This I think represented a sort of ""classic"" (for lack of a better term) approach.   
So for example, if you wanted a nice, natural cinnamon or clary sage perfume, you could mix cinnamon or clary with the other three to good effect.   
But the old classic saying, ""No perfume without jasmine!"" seems to have been replaced implicitly, in recent years, with, ""No perfume without hedione!"" referring to a natural constituent of jasmine. Then the ""wood"" here is the combo of ionone and iso-e super, instead of sandalwood (which contains alpha ionone).   
The Grojsman accord seems like a variation on that ""old classic"" approach to perfumery, in a stripped down, lighter, single molecule form.  
""Iso E Super is also used in concert with a number of other super chemicals that all have differing smells and super powers of scent. Sophia Grojsman used in Tresor chemicals to create an almost totally synthetic fragrance of what she called ""hug me"" accord consisting of: 21% Galaxolide (musk), 18% Iso E Super (cedar), 18% y-methylionone (violet), 6% Hedione (lemon).""

"100% agree, and there are a couple more good reasons to keep in mind:

1. My previous neighbour was a lovely woman with an extremely aggressive (towards other dogs, not people) dog. That dog was gigantic too, must've been at least 120 pounds, which is probably more than the owner. She has always been extremely responsible about it - tried walking him during less busy hours, cross the street if another dog was approaching etc. But if someone's unleashed dog went anywhere near that dog, their dog would be dead within a minute. Sure, YOUR dog might be friendly and well behaved, that doesn't mean OTHER dogs are. Some people have aggressive dogs at no fault of their own. They can be extremely good and responsible about it, but they can do very little when another dog approaches in an uncontrolled and unsolicited manner. The worst part is, not only you'd get your own dog killed, but you'd probably also get the attacking dog euthanized and the other owner traumatized only because you irresponsibly created a situation they couldn't possibly manage.
2. (I'm writing this as a dog owner and lover:) some people are scared of dogs. Some dislike them. Some have religion related issues with them. Some tolerate them but don't care for them all that much. It is not fair for them to have a dog approach them, and it isn't even fair for them to have to fear of your dog approach them, even if it doesn't, when they see your dog isn't leashed. I would love for this city to be more dog friendly - allow them on beaches, public transit, patios of pubs/cafes/restaurants. If you too would like to be able to do all of these things with your dog, be an ambassador for good dog ownership by respecting the people who don't share our love towards them.
3. I've witnessed so many unleashed dogs do their business while the owner wasn't looking (or where the owner couldn't see). Personally, I make a point of letting the owners know and ask them to pick it up, but if there's no one around or they just don't say anything... no one wants to live in a city full of dog shit, and people like that make a bad name for all of us dog owners.

Do the safe and respectful thing. Leash your dog. If you want them to enjoy their freedom, there are designated areas for that.",plural_they
"Here?s what really gets on my nerves about Paul and Morgan?s recent ?commentary? videos. Every single time, they talk about how they aren?t experts. This video specifically they mention that Paul has never watched an episode of the show, and Morgan has casually watched. What makes them think their opinions are so important, that I should take time out of my day to listen to them when I could be listening to an actual expert who has done tons of research?

Secondly, they talk a lot about how Josh is ?the only child to go off the rails?. So why should we judge their parenting or religious lifestyle if only one of nineteen kids is a delinquent? 

Here?s why:

Yes, only one of the nineteen kids has been proven to be terrible. However, Josh molested four of his sisters. The well being of one male child being more important than the safety of four female children should be an immediate red flag, and also points to a concerning statistic. One child is a sexual predator, and four children were victims of that predator. Simply because those four children did not become predators themselves does not mean they escaped their childhood without significant trauma. I think their gauge for if the other children ?turned out alright? is too narrow. I think a parent can fail you even if you don?t turn into a criminal. 

Of the Duggar?s 19 children, 13 are over the age of 18. Personally, I think Jim Bob and Michelle failed at least 5 of their 19 children. Not protecting the daughters is an absolute failure. So they failed in raising 26% of their children. That number jumps to 38% if you only take into account the adult children over the age of 18. 

Those numbers are proof that their parenting and lifestyle are harmful to their children.",plural_they
"Ehh, I don?t think OP is the AH here. I get where everyone is coming from with the whole ?praise? thing but I think internet is doing what internet does and we pick out one little phrase someone uses and hyperfocus on it. I don?t think OP meant they *need praise* I think it was more a comment about the fact that people are literally going there to eat his/her food, and he/she wants feedback on it. If Mary is just a picky eater, and doesn?t eat half the stuff that OP puts love, time, effort, and MONEY into, I don?t think she would be a good fit either. 

Now if Mary said ?Gee OP, I usually really like shrimp, but I?m not a huge fan of these shrimp you made?, and was able to actually provide a comprehensive response as to what exactly she didn?t like about it, we might have an AH who just doesn?t want her there because she doesn?t offer praise. But if literally every time the answer is going to be ?Well I just don?t like it?, that is SO frustrating for a cook because there is nothing you can do about that, except just cooking food they would like, which would then lead to a super bland dinner for the rest of the group. Plus, they also mentioned ?sometimes unfamiliar foods? would also cause Mary to skip things and it?s like you?re not even going to try it??? Fuck off, I wouldn?t want to cook for them either haha. 

Now I think this is a very awkward situation for sure, especially because Mary saw it as a social thing just hanging out, but OP cooks these dinners for people who really enjoy a broad palate of tastes and actually APPRECIATE the food. 

I don?t know if people understand this but people who are really into food talk about it like mechanics talk about cars - there is so much that goes into it, and there really is a science behind it, it?s not just this tastes good or doesn?t taste good. Imagine going to a car show and you invite someone who is great company, but they don?t feel the same way about cars as you do. You wouldn?t want to lose them as a friend of course, but you probably wouldn?t invite them to a car show. *Just because this event happens to be at OP?s house doesn?t mean it?s suddenly an informal social hangout.*

My girlfriend is a huge cook and she hates it when people just eat the food and say ?oh it?s good.? And it?s not because she *needs* to hear it?s *AMAZING*, she needs to hear *why* it?s good, what specifically? And not in a *blow smoke up my ass* way, but an actual critique. If you don?t like her food, you better come correct and have an explanation so she can do it better next time. 

So I don?t think OP was meaning that they need to hear GOOD things, it?s more that they want actual comprehensive feedback. It just probably so happens that they hear ?omg it?s so amazing? more often than not, so that was the wording they chose to express that. 

OP, I don?t know you from a hole in the wall and I could be totally wrong about all this, but I feel your frustration and this is certainly a difficult situation to navigate. I wish you the absolute best, and at the end of the day, I think if Mary is a true friend, she?ll understand, although she may still be hurt, so I think it would be a great idea to have a few other functions soon and inviting her to those so she knows she?s not being kicked to the curb.",specific_unknown_singularthey

"Again, as I argue, it was a choice of Kimchee or Shannon - to take *both* would have completely hamstrung Jung, as he was suddenly without both major relationships in his life. And it made more sense to remove Shannon than to remove Kimchee. And again, it?s not like the spinoff does not have Asian characters already cast. And Andrew Phung, who played Kimchee, is still getting to head up a new show with the same network, so they?re not adverse to giving a new Asian-led show anyway. I think Kim?s would have been far worse for the absence of Kimchee, or Kimchee *and* Shannon, and the showrunners clearly felt she had reached the end of her narrative within Kim?s, going back to iust being Jung?s boss.

As for not finding a new showrunner in time, that?s a hell of a leap to suggest there?s racist tones in that. Racists don?t greenlight and pay for a show about a Korean-Canadian family for five years, and suddenly decide deliberate sabotage is their long game. They may have only seen the show going another year anyway, and see Ins Choi?s departure as just a sign to end it.

As for not having representation in the writers? room, that?s inexcusable. 

On the point of salary, that?s a negotiating thing. If they?re locked into contracts before the show gets big, they?re locked in. Maybe the fifth season was the end of their contracts and they were in a position to renegotiate as a bloc to get better pay, perhaps that plays a hand in the production company just ending the show instead of finding a new showrunner, knowing the costs might go up. We don?t know. But racism, eh... Maybe he?s right. Just from an outside perspective, it?s tough to see where the line between ?miserly? and ?racist? sits.

"Wasn?t saying that. More that she bragged about how easily she beat the other guy, which begs the question of if it was self defense of assault. If it was a one sided beat down, and the other person was not a threat at all; it?s not self defense, it?s assault. 

She went on Live, said how she beat him up, she appears unscathed, and was able to perform the following night. Whereas the other person was bleeding and needed stitches. She calls him a little white boy, Widow is a large man who can fight. It really seems, to me, that Widow had easily won the fight, but didnt know when to stop. I?m literally going off of the Instagram Live and the medical report in the article. 

You can self defend yourself to a point, but if it?s clear that the other party is not a threat, then any continued ?self defense? is assault. At that point, pick them up and kick them out of your apartment. 

I?m open to Widow releasing evidence that this person didn?t receive a major beat down (and the injuries described in the article was exaggerating), that this person was actually threatening, and that the level of force used was necessary. However we have not received any evidence to say otherwise. 

I think Widow was in the right to defend her home to an extent, but I don?t think Widow needed to fight that hard. Had Widow simply yanked him out of their apartment, this wouldn?t have been an issue at all, and I have trouble believing that Widow couldn?t have just done that.",generic_genderedthey

"&gt;Not sure, wish they had had a control group. 

They do. Its right at the bottom of the source. They don't have a control group for every question, but they do have a control group for some of them

 
&gt;34% would inform the police if they thought somebody they knew was getting involved with people who support terrorism in Syria

Only 30% of the control group would inform the police. It looks bad doesn't it, that only 30% would inform the police until you actually look at the question. The question actually provides several answers including talking to the person directly, looking for help, and thinking that no one they know would be involved in terrorism. Most people wouldn't inform the police, because they would seek another way to help them.

&gt;4% sympathise with people who take part in suicide bombings 

&gt;4% sympathise with people who commit terrorist actions as a form of political protest.

As does 1% of the control group for the previous 2 questions. Honestly, this one is so low for both groups it's within the margin of error

&gt;52% do not believe that homosexuality should be legal in Britain

&gt;47% do not believe that it is acceptable for a school teacher to be homosexual

Homosexuality is where they let themselves down

&gt;23% support the introduction of Sharia Law.

This one is very vague. Sharia law is often used as if its this one law that is universal but its not. Sharia law is so vague and open to interpretation that this could mean anything from agreeing that we should cut people's hands off for stealing, to getting married according to Islamic practices. Those 23% could believe in anything within that spectrum and so this particular question is kind of useless because it's too broad.

&gt;32% refuse to condemn those who take part in violence against those who mock the Prophet

There's no control group for this 

&gt;39% agree that ?wives should always obey their husbands?.

&gt;31% think it's acceptable for a man to have more than one wife

They've let themselves down here 

&gt;66% completely condemn those people who take part in stoning those who commit adultery.

That's a words way to also say that 79% condemn it and only 5% sympathise with it which again is within the margin of error compared to the 2% of the control group who also sympathise with stoning people for adultery. 

I don't mean to sound rude, but it seems to me that you haven't actually read your own source. If I'm not mistaken, I believe that you've read a summary where some statistics were plucked out, but you haven't actually delved into the tables themselves. 

When you actually look at the tables, some of those statistics you highlighted no longer seem as bad. From what I've seem from the data, the main issue is over muslims views on gay right and gender equality. In terms of terrorism, they're views are similar to the control groups.

It's not ideal, and you're right that it does seem to violate the spirit of the moderator guidelines, and if Reddit itself.

"All of that and you didnt address my main point, that the CURRENT behaviour of the police today is probably responsible for the low number of minorities who generally want to sign up for the force.

I gave my background to qualify that I am not some hardcore  pro-black activist who mistakenly believes all whites are evil etc.  I indeed dont know what you are, but unlike myself you were afraid to qualify what you are because I would wager you are probably white. 

I gave my academic background and physical condition, because I simply wanted to show I would be more than qualified to join the police.  I havent joined up for reasons I have already explained.

All across your last post was ad hominem attacks. 

""During your post where you seem to think my experiences aren?t valid"". No where have I said your experiences werent valid lol.  I said the police need to look at the CURRENT behaviour of its officers to understand why it retains a negative perception amongst some people.  You were the one banging on about certain cultures and attitudes developed over multiple generations.  

As for using the term 'the police' and having an axe to grind with them, that point actually tickled me.  I have read into the history of policing in a lot countries.  I was a big fan of Mr Bratton NYPD and Guiliani, when they cleared up New York in the 80s.  I was very supportive when he wanted to try his zero tolerance approach over here, but Met officers foolishly rejected him.  In fact that was their mistake as knife crime was just beginnng to become a problem and he may have nipped it in the bud.  Two I appreciate the value of a decent police force, I grew up in council housing and you wont find me asking for radical solutions like defunding the police.  

Also I am not sure I fully understand the thinking behind the desire to have more minorities in the police force in the first place, as I am well read enough to know that it probably wont be the magic bullet some folks think it will be.  Take Baltimore in the US, its police force is majority black.  Did that reduce the number of black males dying at the hands of the police? NOPE. So the issue is making sure officers are well trained and professional.  With work on the community end to help alleviate problems like drug abuse, low educational attainment and even single parenthood etc that act as catalysts for criminality.  So now that I have put that nonsense to bed, lets get back to the real issues.

As for why a mother may pull a child away from an officer.  You might be partly right about historical injustices playing a part.  But you cant underplay such experiences, like I said I am British Nigerian, culturally we are quite different from West Indians, nonetheless we are another black group.  The West Indians arrived in the UK came well before us.  Speaking to some older Caribbean men about their experiences with the police isnt for the faint hearted.  Their experiences of suss laws and section vans that just picked them up and bad officers gave them a good hiding, would play a part in why a good number of them hate officers today.  But that could easily be undone if officers didnt compound that historical negativity with bad behaviour today.

Also you act as if police brutality is ancient history like the 60s or 70s, the recent death of rashan charles 2017 who ultimately didnt have any class As on him is a good example.  Why he did he run from the police good question, was the package of paracetamol and caffeine a bit suspect probably (but not illegal).  But nonetheless the interaction with officers shouldn't have resulted in a death.  

In the Nigerian community which is very closeknit the death of Christopher Alder went down like a lead balloon.  This guy fought for the UK in the falklands and then became a computer programmer.  He ultimately died face down in a cell with his trousers/pants down by his ankles with officers making monkey noises in the background.  This was in 1998, that isnt ancient history.

Those two cases were recent and despite this I wont say I dislike the police.  I will say that officers have a tough job and most are good men and women who do their utmost to do their job with highest level of professionalism.

As for why I am on an police reddit?  Good question, it just happened to come up on my timeline.  I saw the post and decided to give my opinion on the matter.  Also the very nature of your question shows that it is a bit of an echo chamber.  You already made loads of incorrect assumptions about me, that I hated the police or I am prejudiced against them, I am really am not.  When I visit my parents old home country Nigeria, the need for effective security forces like decent police/army isnt lost on me. 

In a very patronising way you tried to explain what reddit was all about.  I dont think I have been disagreeable at all.  

I just tried to explain why the police are struggling to recruit minorities in my opinion.

I also tried to show how certain sections of the police have very entrenched ideas and approaches, which you have done little to dispel.  Your mischaracterisation of my motives is a perfect example. Your inability to fully understand major failings in current police officer behaviour on the streets today is another.

As for me avoiding certain questions, I am sure I didnt, but pose me any direct questions you want and I will be more than happy to answer them.

Finally I wanted to dispel this myth that minorities like black people even like the idea of positive discrimination, a lot of us really dont.  We also dont appreciate certain sections of the force saying they have to lower standards to get minorities in, when guys like myself who are more than qualified do exist.  

Have a nice day.  If you do respond, if you have some reasonable questions or replies I will take the time to respond.  But if it more of the recent stuff, I will say we are at an impasse and say lets sadly leave it there..  I am on holiday as its the little man's half term, off to the seaside..

"Eh, u/Specialist_Hornet488 may have some bad points they've made. 

But saying your use of ""autistic"" is used in an insulting matter isn't one of them. And it should be decently easy to see why it could, at the least, be viably interpreted as being an intentional insult. 

---------------------------

&gt; Actually saying that you're mature for your age is pretty autistic even for a 14 year old. That's a pretty stupid thing to write out yea.

There was no mention of Specialist being autistic. So to bring up autism out of left field is the first red flag. 

The second red flag is that it's used in the matter of saying ""that's pretty autistic of you."" You're using it in a way to denote that it's bad how Specialist said they're mature for their age. Making a point that 14 yos can be overconfident in their knowledge of the world is a valid point to make. But qualifying it as specifically ""autistic"" (when again, autism was brought out of left field) is demonstrative of it being used in a negative sense. 

And as a third red flag that you're using it as an insult, the follow-up sentence is where you specifically call it a stupid thing to say. And as you described the thing you clarify as stupid as being autistic, that further cements that use of ""autistic"" as derogatory. 

&gt; Edit: holy shit; your reply is the most autistic thing I've ever read;

Again, your use of ""holy shit"" a priori to your use of ""autistic"" clearly links it into a negative sense. 

------------------------

If you genuinely aren't meaning to use ""autistic"" as a slur in this context, I hope you at least understand now why it's completely valid for Specialist to have interpreted your use of ""autistic"" as a slur. 

But if you're trying to insult Specialist and then say ""you're stupid for thinking I'm insulting you"" then I gotta say that's a jerk move. Even if a person's position isn't the most viable, that's still not a license to needless insult.",plural_they

"I find LMB to be SUCH a breath of fresh air. She is so transparent about makeup being a luxury, being soothing, being stupidly overpriced, and a source of great joy for HER.  I personally feel she does a great job openly articulating the complicated feelings about beauty, self care, FOMO, and ?value?.  A sparkly shadow can be many different things to different people, but I feel LMB does a good job of justifying her items by use and the rather intangible factor of ?joy?.  These are the same conversations I have with myself when I buy anything non-essential.  ?How is it packaged? Can I use it over and over? Will I really use it? Should I get the cheaper one even though it looks ugly?? 

Do I really NEED another Halloween themed plant pot??? No.  Do I enjoy seeing all my plants in black and spooky themed containers? Yes.  Did I buy another yesterday? Yes. Do I regret it? Ummmm no.  It was $4.  A solo cup could provide the same thing at about five cents a cup.  So I overpaid for the ?thing? but having a NOS bat and pumpkin planter (former tea light thingy) is obviously kinda awesome to ME.  

My $80 a month wild bird seed expenses is also utterly insane?but that is my passion so where I spend foolishly.  If bird feeding was a paying gig?ohhh I would have waaaaay more than my 30+ feeders and I can guarantee they wouldn?t all be thrifted 

All this is to say that for ME, LMB serves to remind me to be kind to myself, and very deliberate in choosing the items I surround myself with.  Will I ever, ever, ever buy an $80 tropical themed candle? No.  But did I buy 12 candles Black Friday and used them every single day?  Every day I made Spouse pick a candle of the day, and it was a small pointless source of joy.  Her single shadows are no different, or her floss, or her puzzles?or even her lip balms.  I feel like she is the definition of conscious consumption.  She has a reason, and very often that reason is ?cuz I want it, it is pretty?. And if that is the truth, and you own it, then shop responsibly and have at it.  She has made me aware of a puritanical trait I have of ?going without? as if it is a virtue?I?m much happier being able to donate stuff simply because I don?t love it, and keeping stuff because it has an intangible value.",plural_they

"Query Help, Please!

Hi All, I've recently scrapped my entire query and started from scratch. I was hoping to get some feedback, both positive and negative. Thank you so much for your help!

Title: Color Magic  

  
Genre: YA fantasy
  

  
Word count: 72,000
  

  
Type of feedback desired: structure, flow, form. 

Dear Mx. Agentlast,
  

  
In a world of light against shadow, it is her color that will allow humanity to thrive.
  

  
Not allowed to go anywhere but to school by her dying mother, 16-year-old Maya just wants to paint. Then Maya's desires explode in a magical prism of color in their isolated farmhouse, and Mama uses her last breaths to reveal Maya?s been hidden because her magic is at the heart of the great augury. She is meant to restore balance between the witches of the light who inspire creativity and the too-powerful warlocks of the shadows who strive for structure. If she doesn?t, the art she loves will be overcome by the warlocks? monochromatic efficiency that already runs most of North America.
  

  
Escaping to her mother?s hometown after the funeral, Maya struggles to master her craft at light school and hides from the warlocks like the other witches around her. Meanwhile, she uses her color magic to paint Picassos and Rembrandts in the alleys around town. When her friends are awed by her artistry, she is inspired to challenge the Table of the Round that rules the witches and take on the fight they gave up. Now Maya must lead her friends into battle, but if she loses the war, the warlocks? shadows will drain her of life, just like they did her mother.
  

  
Complete at 72000 words, COLOR MAGIC is a fast-paced YA fantasy. It will appeal to readers of Half Bad by Sally Green and The Bright and The Pale by Jessica Rubinowski. I am excited to submit COLOR MAGIC to you because of your interest in XXX.
  

  
I have a BA in Literature and teach high school English in Toronto, Canada, where I live with my wife and two still-adorable children.
  

  
Thank you for your consideration.
  

  
Sincerely yours,",plural_they
"The beauty of responding to harassment with pure screaming insanity is that people are 10x more likely to want to get the heck away from a ?scene? than pull out a knife and engage in a fight with someone who isn?t scared of them (and is potentially REALLY dangerous), particularly in daylight with people around. Thugs hate drawing attention. 

But! There are PLENTY of less aggressive ways to effectively defuse situations. My bear-rush suggestion is for when you?re surrounded and scared, but here are some other options that work EVEN if you live in an area with knife violence. 

Remember: every violent offender is still a human being who responds instinctively to being spoken to by another human. You can use that to change situations entirely from threatening to pleasant. I?ve done it so often it?s now second nature to me. Practice saying sentences like this over and over again so that if the time comes again, the words are on the tip of your tongue:

Them: jeering about your self-harm scars 
You: ?Oh, these scars? I did this to myself with a knife because I?ve been suffering from mental issues. I can explain how to give yourself scars like these if you like them, but honestly, most people just think you?re a nutter so I wouldn?t recommend it.? 

Them: ?You?re fat!?
You: ?You think THIS is fat? You see see how fat I used to be; it would blow your mind.?

Them: ?Slags like you make it hard for good men like us!?
You: (laugh happily) ?I absolutely agree with you! That?s why I like girls, I don?t think any REAL man should be subjected to a slag like me.?

Them: ?Wanna f*ck sweetheart??
You: ?First of all, thank you for the compliment, but no, I?ve been sexually abused in the past and I honestly just have a lot of issues surrounding sex, my therapist says I should engage in open conversation with anyone who triggers my mental issues  but actually, I?ve got somewhere to be, maybe if you?re still around on my way back we can talk about my issues, and maybe yours if you?d like.?

Once you remove your resistance to what they?re saying, the fun is gone. And, no man cat-calling a woman wants to sit down and talk about feelings, which makes that last one a particularly effective. People are SUPER uncomfortable with the words ?I was sexually abused? and they will squirm in their seats.

And, finally, NEVER UNDERESTIMATE THE POWER OF LOOKING SOMEONE IN THE EYES, SMILING, AND POLITELY SAYING HELLO. I?ve had harassers THANK me because I?m not afraid to respond to ?Hey girl, wanna f*ck!? with ?Thank you, but I?m in love with my husband!? If they keep pushing, I just say, ?Oh, I really love him and I could never do him wrong like that, and I wouldn?t treat you like that if you were my man, either.? At least 5 men have literally said, ?Know what, I appreciate that? to me after that. ?? But! That?s the power of humanizing a harasser. 

Not being afraid of engaging in conversation shows that you?re not scared. It shows that you?re viewing them as a human and not as a threat, and people will literally change how they?re acting to meet that ?not a threat? expectation you put out there. Look every single person in the eye and acknowledge them. Even when you?re surrounded by a group of jeering teenagers. Look at each one and say, ?Hello.? Ask THEM questions: ?Where are you guys from? What are your names? Who?s the youngest? Who?s the oldest? Who?s the best at biking in the group??

Anyhow, I know I?m a mama hen trying to take care of her little rollerskating chicks all over this green earth, but I hope you?ve gotten at least a few useful ideas from things I?ve written. Good luck, my young friend, and skate on! ????",generic_singularthey
"Exactly this. We're not going to be looking for 100m for any of Coutinho/Griezmann/Dembele. A fair amount will be fine because all 3 of them are on insane wages. If we could get even 30m for Coutinho that's about half the budget of what we'd need for a CB, but then getting his stupid wages off the bill gives us a lot of room as well.

Dembele might fetch up to 50m (maybe even more) and Griezmann probably a bit more than that considering his form lately.

"I think those 2 wordings imply exactly the same thing to anyone that bothers thinking about it.

Since people don't generally think a lot (good for them, inner peace), it'll really depend on how the media and social networks pushes it in their face.

So basically, everything is still possible society wise. This could be the biggest thing ever, even if we aren't provided with any proof at all.

This could also be completely forgotten after a few days, even if there's solid data in the report.

I doubt even aliens can predict what will happen, unless time isn't linear for them.

Here's what I think will happen. Nothing, except that gross incompetence and negligence by the army won't be accepted further. Let's be real, the greatest army in the world with the greatest tech and connection to the greatest minds has all it takes to figure this out.

Communicate with them, observe them, capture them, shoot em down, help them, corner them, trap them, detect them, report them. Do something! This is what will come out of this. And it'll work, I hope.

""Oh we can only fly for one hour with our fighter jets, it's so hard to observe them."" Send drones you fuckwits, circle em 24/7, get footage of those incredible accelerations and transmedium capabilities. Shoot them with paintball and see what happens, throw flowers or salt at them for all I care. I just can't believe the army has been so incompetent until now. But then I look at our response to covid and yes, it's believable.

The army has been so dumb about this. If you think humans learnt anything with Pearl Harbor and 9/11, you live in fantasy world.

I figure that if the report comes out June 25th, we get some uproar the first week, official directives are given after 7 days to investigate further, that leaves them 2-3 weeks by July 8-18th to EMP one of those prime directive abiding voyeur alientards. :P

"I'm not sure if you were around at the time, but Bioware promised either 7 or 11 (don't remember which, damn that store) unique endings tailored to the choices you made. That clearly didn't happen, and bred a lot of bad blood given how much the Bioware team was hyping the huge impacts your choices were going to have. Then it turned out saving the Rachni just changed a number. It turned out keeping the collector base just changed a number. It turned out letting the council die was just a pallet swap, all the way up to the end of the trilogy. 

There was *a lot* of telling instead of showing in Mass Effect 3. You were *told* that your choices mattered, but most of that had to be filled in with head canon. Frankly, most of your choices only mattered for the personal head-canon story you were building for yourself. For players who need more visual results and reminders of their choices, ME3 dropped the ball hard.

Combine that with a huge number of players not being able to import their Shepard due to bad programming, Day 1 Prothean DLC, photoshop filter Tali, and a story that had a very steep drop in quality after the Geth v Quarian conflict and there was a discontent. The ending drama wasn't just the ending, it was a lot of emotions over a lot of problems with the game/series that all got rolled into the ending. From that perspective, the response to the ending makes a lot more sense.

EDIT: Forgot to mention the multiplayer being necessary for the ""best"" destroy ending, the final grind to the crucible being extremely aggravating, and Kai Leng the canonized fan fic character who came out of no where as the main antagonist with plot armor.

From this comparison you'll have a good view on the weapons and you can choose. I personally would go for Cyclones if I have the resources to spend, or else Retaliators are the way to go.",plural_they

"&gt; The republican party thinks freedom of speech means freedom of consequence.

Consequences for bad speech are generally fine. It's acceptable for someone to lose a job for insulting their boss. But if you're saying this to suggest that Facebook and Twitter should be allowed to deplatform people arbitrarily then you're using it as an excuse for bad behavior. Consequences from social media platforms should follow from objective violations of their terms of service that can be cited by their moderators. The consequences should be minimal to bring the content in line with their terms of service.

&gt; Free speech means you're allowed to say whatever you want without being arrested for it (so long as you aren't advocating violence or threatening someone). That's literally all it and the 1st amendment mean.

I value free speech as an ideal, it transcends its implementation in the first amendment. If the first amendment is insufficient to protect the free flow of ideas, and it is in this case, other legislation can and should be implemented to make up for its shortcomings.

&gt; Content removed is content that is deemed dangerous or harmful.

I agree that there's some interesting questions about misinformation and Trump's case specifically. I think Twitter and Facebook are approaching the question in good faith, but I'm unsatisfied with the answers so far. I recall seeing solid criticisms of Twitter's fact-checkers. I think companies _should_ be able to have moderation policies around misinformation, but those policies should be made to be as objective as possible and prevent bias from moderators from becoming a factor.  

&gt; When speech turns to actions, and those actions are of a violent variety, that's when it's not a speech issue.

I see where you're coming from, but I respectfully disagree. It isn't anyone's place to decide what speech crosses that line. Should the media be held responsible for hyping up George Floyd's murder and causing rioting? No. Because people are ultimately responsible for their own actions which are separate from the speech.

&gt; It will be struck dead when it's challenged and taken to court, because Florida can't decide what big tech can and cannot do.

I hope not - but we'll see. If Florida lacks the authority, would you feel differently if it were the federal government? I don't see why the federal government can enact net neutral rules on ISPs while not implementing moderation rules on social media companies.

&gt; Besides which, this framing of ""right censorship"" is patently false.

You're right. It happens to left-wing people too sometimes. It's wrong then too.

&gt; The hate doesn't stem from a hierarchy, it stems from people who actively make the lives of others inherently worse.

I agree. There's problems with the system that tend to affect different groups in different proportions. I think there should be solutions to those problems. I just don't think that the groups themselves should be given first class consideration in those discussions. There should be root cause analysis done to determine how the system impacts people based on their individual circumstances.

I acknowledge that there's a correlation between Black people and policing, but I reject that their ""Blackness"" is the leading cause of that correlation. I'd suggest that their socio-economic status is a larger factor. Solutions should target the socio-economic factors and not the race.

It's reasonable to point out the broad statistics that Whites have higher incomes than Blacks, but it's unreasonable to demonize an individual White person for causing system issues - which is what I see happening.

&gt; Pushing back on all what? Non-issues that aren't actually affecting anyone in any meaningful way?

Today my employer held an all-hands meeting where we discussed DEI. Specifically, the 30 minute meeting discussed:

* That the term ""whitelist"" is unacceptable - without explaining why it was unacceptable.
* What a microagression is and some examples. The prescribed solution in all 3 cases was to not say anything to colleagues.
* How to update your gender pronouns in Slack.

These are, in my opinion, non-issues that don't affect anyone. But my employer is sponsoring patronizing meetings about it. If the right wing media wants to make fun of them, I'm here for that.

"You'll want to avoid addressing the problem head-on, at least to start with. Handling this sort of situation is, in itself, a skill. A people skill! That is to say, you may have more luck if you modify your own behaviour than if you call them out on theirs.

In this particular instance, you'll want to switch from telling them the answer to guiding them to the answer. Your objective is to teach them the skills to do it themselves, and equally as important, the confidence to try. Depending on the situation, I'd suggest combining these two approaches: 

1. Ask questions, especially ones you know the answer to
1. Say things like ""I don't know, lets work it out together""

For example, say they've gotten an exception and have a stacktrace. You could say something like ""what's the stacktrace say?"" and they might come back with ""I dunno, its in some library code"", and now they get to learn how to navigate stacks! Or maybe you say ""what happens if you put a breakpoint on it?"". Or even just ""what does stack overflow say?"" - these are all skills you'll probably have, that they might not.

If you assume that they lack the skills necessary, you'll learn and demonstrate to others your people and teaching skills. And by making them do the work they'll either appreciate the help and opportunity to learn, thus removing their need to ask you over time, or if they're just being lazy you'll make asking you less attractive because now they have to actually do the work.",

"Especially when so many folks with COVID are asymptomatic, I don't think you can really rule anywhere out these days. 

Anyway, I think for the main point you're getting at here there are quite a few holes that would need filled. 

Firstly would be the facilities demand for laundry services and shower amenities. Anecdotally speaking, my wife and I used to clean several doctors offices of an evening during the week and none of them had shower or laundry facilities. So you'd face an outlay to bring every facility into line with at least having locker room facilities. Laundry could be subbed out, but would drive costs and likely harder to come by in rural areas (among others). For businesses unable to expand to these new requirements, they'd have to take the space out of somewhere, perhaps eating in to their ability to see as many patients throughout the day (lower their profits and cause delays in recieving care)?

Once facilities are in place and laundry is available, then you have to convince/force the employees to shower. Let's just call a spade a spade here and admit we can't even get folks to regularly wash their hands after relieving themselves. I imagine forcing a shower would be an uphill battle. 

The last - but certainly not least - thing that comes to mind for this exercise is why shower/ change clothes only at the end of the day? If avoiding transmission is the top goal, should probably be doing this after each patient. Not everyone that goes to a hospital is sick, and not all sick people have the same thing after all.

&gt;Traces the extraordinary resonance a single choice, even a single word, can have over the course of a lifetime. Seen through the eyes of young Linda Fallon and the young man who loves her.
&gt;
&gt;Anita Shreve, the bestselling author of The Pilot's Wife, returns with a dazzling new novel about love, forgiveness, and paths not followed. 
&gt;
&gt;Linda Fallon encounters her former lover, Thomas Janes, at a literary festival where both have been invited to give readings from their work. It has been years since their paths crossed, and in that time Thomas has become a kind of literary legend. His renown is enhanced by his elusiveness; for most of the past decade, he has remained in seclusion following a devastating loss. 
&gt;
&gt;This is no chance meeting. Thomas learned that Linda was reading at the festival and chose this moment to reestablish contact with a woman he passionately pursued years earlier. Their affair was disastrous, and a turning point in both their lives. Neither the intensity of their relationship nor the damage it did has ever been far from his memory. From the moment they speak, The Last Time They Met unfolds the story of Linda and Thomas in an extraordinary way: it travels back into their past, bypassing layers of memory and interpretation to present their earlier encounters with unshakable immediacy. In Africa, when Linda and Thomas were twenty-seven, and in Massachusetts, when they were in high school, the novel re-creates love at its exhilarating pinnacle - the kind of intense connection that becomes the true north against which all relationships are measured. Moving backward through time, The Last Time They Met traces the extraordinary resonance a single choice, even a single word, can have over the course of a lifetime. At the same time, the novel creates an almost unbearable mystery, a mystery that can only be understood fully in the novel's final pages, in the eyes of young Linda Fallon and the young man who loves her. 
&gt;
&gt;With a master's control of phrase, observation, emotion, and character, Anita Shreve has written a beautiful and unforgettable exploration of intimacy, loss, and lifelong desire.

"Great analysis, so much info thank you! I think I see a clearer picture now, Lucid will be competing in both the luxury and regular mass markets without diluting their brand. Lucid will not sell to BMW, Audi, etc. because they are direct competitors. In the regular mass market, Lucid will not produce cars but instead license their tech to the likes of Toyota. Thus they can still make money from the mass market without having to put their brand on it. 

* Luxury Market: Luxury OEMs will spend years trying to catch up to battery tech. Tesla will struggle to provide luxury and continue losing brand value as their cars become more common and cheap. No company can provide both cutting edge tech + luxury.....except Lucid. 
* Mass Market: Most OEMs have the capacity to produce at large volume, but has low level battery tech. Tesla has the tech but not the volume capability. No mass market company can provide both high level tech + volume.......except whoever partners with Lucid

Sounds like Lucid will have a huge market share if this continues as expected. I am hoping they get to partner with Honda or Toyota. Hyundai's quality and sale volume is not that great.

"Will report back on effects. Currently pretty medicated on the rude boi og preroll I picked up. I?m not a big joint guy but sheesh muv doesn?t disappoint
(also ice cream gelato smells nearly identical to GH?s yellow brick road, just with a slight gassy undertone when broken up which is nice)

Also I have to add that when I say ?not the strongest smelling?... Yes the flower is pretty decent smelling for FL grown flower... but overall could be improved! None of the flower I?ve picked up has been ?perfect? in any way but it is by far some of the best FL grown flower at the moment! Muv is on a good path, and so far have been the only place capable of providing solid entourage effects for me in flower (other than GH but not recently)

RUDE BOI OG pre-roll: Can?t say much because I just had a pre-roll... but I was VERY impressed with this strain. Usually pre rolls do pretty much NOTHING at all for me so my expectations were very low.. but all I can say is DAMN. Would recommend this for a concert or party. I?m the type of person who is very influenced by music (also very OCD lol) and when I?m by myself I need to be able to choose exactly what song I?m listening to to fit the exact vibe I?m currently in and for once I just didn?t care. The music just felt good and I let my playlist run through without even changing the song once. Loved the body effects on this strain, the music felt noticeably better than usual. Possibly #1 for pain relief ATM but would have to try more to really know obviously. 

ICE CREAM GELATO: Super happy with this pick up and definitely glad I got two. Smoke is super smooth and instantly you are hit with a numbing full body sensation that forces you to close your eyes and completely eases all tension for a few brief seconds. Definitely indica leaning, but also has that nice sativa-like ?trippiness? to it so I?d say it?s perfect for later in the day or days where you don?t have much to do. Solid entourage effect!! Reminds me of some classic high end Cali ?Runtz? we?ve been seeing pop up in the past few years and I hope Florida (MUV!!!) continues to go down this road with their flower?? 

CLEMENTINE: WOW I think I like this more than sour jack. Perfect orange peel taste on the exhale. Classic sativa that hits right in your head, but also provides a nice full body sensation that will have you floating. Nice and racy, a little bit of anxiety but in a good, fun way. I enjoy strains like this because they really get me going and force me to face my anxiety early in the day. Great strain to add to your get up and go collection and I?ll definitely be looking to pick this up again. Again some of the better entourage effects in the program.

SLURRICANE: One of my new favorites. I would 1000% recommend this to someone who is looking for something to give them a ?happy? effect. Can?t really make out the smell but it?s like very subtle berries with a prevalent hint of sour. Definitely hybrid leaning for me. I definitely get that classic trippy/racy effect with this strain too (not so much in a sativa way.. more of a hybrid racy if you know what I mean)! One of those strains where you?re sitting there feeling like everyone?s looking at you because you just blinked weird but at the same time you?re too stoned to care lol. Not too sedative but not something I?d wanna smoke too much of before talking to a lot of people. Definitely had me in my head more than most strains but in a GREAT way!! I?d recommend this strain for someone creative looking for something to really get the mental juices flowing. Also great strain for boring tasks! Really makes the time fly by like nothing, much more than other strains I?ve had.
Once again great entourage effects:) 

DURBAN DAWG: Wasn?t too impressed by the initial bag appeal but you can?t always judge a book by its cover! Nice subtle fruity smell to it that I can?t quite make out. Kinda reminds me of fruity pebbles. Since it?s been sitting around for a couple days the smell has definitely started to come out more. This reminds me of one of those classic strains you?d smoke on a day off school back in the day and just kinda lay around all day in a daze.

"They are probably basing it on total people picking incorrectly. That series had a smaller panel, so even though 100% of them picked wrong it was only 14 incorrect predictions. So this series being 17 incorrect would be second behind their 22 incorrect for the Blazers/Pels series. Still seems like a pretty dumb way to do it though. If they expanded the panel to 100 members and they were split 50/50 then that would be the new ""most incorrect"" by the same standard. It definitely should go off of percent incorrect.",specific_unknown_singularthey

"Absolutely no disagreements that they were/are dictatorships, however I do disagree that they were/are communist or socialist, but I understand why you think they were/are.

Due to the Red Scare, what most people think of communism and socialism isn?t the actual meanings of those words. Communism is a stateless, classless, moneyless society and socialism is the direct worker ownership and management of the means of production. The MoP being workplaces, resources, and distribution centers. Ex: Factories, lumber yards, and grocery stores. Not ?when the government does stuff? or dictatorships. In fact, communism and socialism are very egalitarian and equal in nature. 

Contrary to the names of their ruling parties and countries neither the USSR or China are socialist/communist. Neither had direct worker control of the MoP, the MoP are controlled by the state or private capitalists, which also means that they have classes. They both have currency. And they both have a state.

"So would you be ok if the large tech giants all teamed up to extremely censor certain political candidates and push ideologies? What if they all decided they were going to push for an authoritarian system where they replace the government with themselves, repeal the first amendment, etc. They start by blocking all information that goes against that, and using fake sites they create and fake accounts on social media they start making it look like 80% of Americans support this.

Then they segregate people they think are going to go against thier plan and feed them false information, e.g. they censor all voting stuff and only push sites with the incorrect dates for voting.

Do you really think they should be able to do this as much as they want?

"INTJs are gonna be calm when it comes to tribe vs self issues because their deciding functions (Te, Fi) are in the middle of their stack, 2nd and third position and thus share a 60-40 balance. INTJs are much better and jumping between their own values and wants and the reasons of the tribe and what works for the outside world. 
INTJs have a massive imbalance in terms of observing functions (1st Ni and 4th Se) and there is going to a massive imbalance or these weird swinging tidal waves of reality that hits them, because they were too cause up in their own Ni idealistic vision (Ni is responsibility to organising concepts- Ne is responsibility to gathering concepts) and would rather push away reality than change their Ni. They are gonna want control and fear chaos in a sense, and will more often than Intps not gather enough real world data which trips them up (ie. Intj was so busy in their dream vision of their business that when it came to getting work done, they were so flooded with boring laborious sensory stuff and no time for mastermind planning). 
Also Te is about solving problems outside of yourself, for the tribe. What works best for everyone? Maybe a Te simplistic design will be easier for everyone to understand and therefore work better. Te cares about feedback from tribe, and the theories of INTJs are personal to them. You call their idea stupid and they won?t take it as a personal attack. 

Ti doesn?t care about tribe or take responsibility for others understanding. It wants to understand for itself, so often a nice complex theory that no one in the tribe can understand cause it?s sooooo personal to the Intp will be preferred. You attack an Intps idea and it?s gonna be taken a little bit personally- cause it?s THEIR unique Ti idea. 
Te is throwing jenga blocks of ideas and ?tips? at people to quickly solve problems. Ti is a complex Jenga block castle that takes a very in-depth approach, you can?t just throw jenga block ideas with Ti. 

Intp will have have issues with self above tribe, because their is a big imbalance between 1st Ti (understanding and creating theories for the self- what works for me) deciding function and 4th Fe (does the tribe actually want/ like to do my Ti idea? No? Don?t care). Intps will still enjoy theories of chaos and control in the world, but ultimately, it?s not the lifelong issue they will get stuck on. It?s not gonna cause them lifelong severe pain. The tribe/world not aligning with them/ not understanding them will be an issue they can?t just solve so easily.

Also Intps have Ne- this is gathering of concepts. NOT ORGANISING. You just gather more ideas and more more more knowledge but when you organise (Si), you will be organising things in the real world. You will be organising facts the who what where when why. Organising THINGS, my ?stuff?. Think excel spreadsheets and diaries and rules/standards to compare real world things to and organise what fits and what doesn?t. You?re will gather patterns, concepts, possibilities and then organise your stuff in the real world to meet these possibilities and ideas taht you have gathered in a cute big ass pile. 

INTJs do this with concepts, Ni organising concepts, but will Se gather sensory data (not organise it, just gather it). Se What does it look like? What actually happened? What was actually said? And then Ni organising that into a bigger conclusion/ prediction of the world.",plural_they
"It's a good subject to mull over and I can see it from both point of views. On one hand you really shouldn't go around insulting and mouthing off to people you don't know. That is for personal safety/mental health. On the other yes people should just ignore things and move on.

But it all has a limit and certain circumstances and mitigating factors happen all the time. Maybe the woman asked the driver a simple question and was told to fuck off. Maybe this wasn't the first encounter and the driver just got fed up with it and it triggered some trauma.

Diving deeper in at what point can you just not ignore the words? Let's say for example you are forced to interact with a person every single day (boss, spouse, parent, neighbor, imaginary friend) and they just spit and froth the most vile insults they can think of at you for the entire time you two interact and then follow it up by repeating the claims to everyone and anyone who is in their sphere of influence. What if they begin to subject a loved one of yours to that also? What if it gets to the point of sexual harassment and threats of death or violence? What if they show up to your dog's funeral and tell you they poisoned your dog?

Everything has a limit, and words used to offend and anger others on purpose have a limit. You cannot go around everyday expecting no one to ever react. I cannot feel sympathy for a person getting slapped if they treated another person poorly. Even if it isn't the mature or proper thing to do. 

Just a sad state of society, very few people have had mentors in their life to walk them through how fluid you have to be in your encounters on a daily basis. When to walk away, when you simply can't. How to react and not over react, and how you have other avenues to settle up your grievances aside violence.",generic_singularthey

"If you are low income [less than $15,000/year] you would qualify for Medi-Cal. I used to go to the LA LGBT center for HRT, they take Medi-Cal and most other insurances, and if you're not insured they do sliding scale [I remember I used to pay around $30 per doctor's visit when I was uninsured]. They also have trans support groups and legal aid to help you change your name. I'm also pretty sure they have a list of surgeons in LA county for trans related surgeries.

"I grew up in India, and until 2018, being gay was illegal, period.  Although India has decriminalized homosexuality, there's no semblance of equality on any parameters.

What helped me was I have a liberal family who never made an issue out of it. I know that mom, dad and my brother will ALWAYS have my back. And that gave me the strength to come out. And, for a uber conservative country like India, I was surprised by how many people were wonderfully accepting, even though they didn't understand it. It gave me the confidence to engage respectfully with people who had opinions based on a lack of, or a misunderstanding of information.  I found that the more I engaged with them, the more they were likely to understand and accept. 

But most of all, coming out lifted this massive boulder off my chest. All that anxiety went away. I didn't have to lie anymore. Yeah, some people couldn't deal with it - I simply ejected them from my life. They didn't deserve me.

My honest and sincere advice would be to come out to your family and close friends if you can. Once you have their support, the world seems a lot less hostile. Then take it from there. If your family aren't thrilled at the idea, then you have some work to do, but you should definitely do the work. They'll find out eventually, and the older people get, he more set in their opinions they get, so the easiest time to change anyone's mind about it is now.  

Of course, you could also migrate to a more accepting place, but that doesn't deal with the issues that come with having to lie to your near and dear ones.",plural_they

1. There's nowhere near enough information in this article to make an assessment of whether the allegations are fair and reasonable. 

2. The ECB have acknowledged a degree of wrongdoing but there's no information as to what this wrongdoing in Holder's case or whether it would amount to discrimination based on race. 

3. The ECB is hardly going to call itself institutionally racist regardless of any outcome they'll more likely refute the allegation and pledge to be better.

Now a rant, similarly to others in this thread I have some personal criticisms of taking the knee at sports events and these cheap gestures that I feel do nothing to create change. At this point I don't feel like you're raising awareness unless the crowd and TV audience have all just come out of long term comas.

I would be much more interested in hearing how they look to invest to make meaningful change and see it demonstrated. 

Discussions of race and prejudice should go much further than simply taking a knee. This has been shown to be the case in legal actions brought against employers like Cisco and Facebook in the states where they make a song and dance about their Indian minority hires but do not recognise caste based discrimination even as it happens within their own companies. In other words, it's not as simple as saying 'look we've got one of them now, we're in the clear'. 

All these matters of discrimination and prejudice need to be ongoing and open communications rather than taking a knee, wearing a t shirt and going about thinking you've done your bit. If organisations are serious about it, pledge meaningful change, explain how you intend to achieve it and then show us how you're achieving it. Rant over.",plural_they

I want you to open an amazon tab right now and order yourself a baby wrap/sling for LO - from now on EVERY SINGLE SECOND you spend in MILs presence you will wear LO in that wrap.

Speaking of being in MIL's presence. From this second on she is no longer welcome in your home. Ever. Change your locks because you know bitch has spare keys (you can get a new barrell from anyone harware shop for less then 20 and fit it yourself in less than 5 minutes - all you need is a star head screwdriver. youtube has loads of tutorials but I recommend the one from b&amp;q which is also available on [diy.com](https://diy.com).

From this moment on you NEVER spend time alone with MIL - DH must be there at all times - he leaves the room to make coffee then you and LO go with him.

MIL takes/tries to take LO off you then practice this - you need to say it LOUDLY so it attracts the attention of everyone around you but don't shout - 'MIL DON'T lift LO!' followed by 'MIL I SAID NO! Give me back LO!' physically get up and follow her and lift LO out of her arms - imagine you are talking to a naughty dog and repeat 'I said NO!'

Don't be afraid to leave situations/tell her to leave - be firm and calm. If you are leaving simply take LO and go. If you want her to leave then, no matter who all is there, simply say 'MIL you need to leave now.' and keep repeating it, don't get drawn into an argument

You also need to have a sit down talk with your DH about his mother. Before you do make list of things - write them down because it's hard to argue with a written list of evidence - of all the things she has done/does that upset/undermine/endanger LO- when you start writing them down like that I think you will actually shock yourself at how many of them there are.

then you need to decide what you are comfortable with contact wise. You've already said no to her having alone time with LO - WHO THE FUCK tries to feed an 11 week old baby pasta sauce - that's just sugar and salt and acid. even if LO WERE old enough for 'food' that would never be the food of choice - sounds like she is determined to be the one to have that 'first' - so she no longer gets to be around Lo during mealtimes.

I'd personally be taking a massive step back to LC. block MIL on your phone and social media. let all contact go through DH.

In the meantime I'd be making appointments with LOs doctors / healthvisitors and discussing what MIL has been doing with them - her locking your baby away from you, trying to forcefeed your baby food that they aren't ready for, refusing to hand them back when hungry etc - then i'd take your DH along to those appointment and let him hear from the medical professionals how dangerous his mother is and how detrimental to LOs and your helath and mental welfare MIL is - it might be the only thing that get's through to him, and if not then time to pack up your stuff and head to your mums or a friends with LO for for a while.

She has not only ruined your experiences as a new mother, she has traumatised you and your baby and endangered your baby. So she no longer gets to be around baby.",specific_unknown_singularthey

"Generally speaking, the group that has the most agency in a particular context, receives pushback from those that lack the autonomy.

So for example, if a parent complains about their child that usually poor form, but if a child complain about a parent then it's fine or society considers it a problem for the parent.

Or if a boss complain publicly about their workers it get's a bunch of editorial and tweets saying he's wrong, but if employee complain about their boss they can go to support group which meets at any bar.

"60k seems great but it seems like you will pay 10k in taxes. If you work 25 days a month at 10 hours a day you are only making 16/hr after taxes.

I do not have a good feeling of this family. They are getting over. The salary looks great until you do the math. The salary  looks good  but being paid per hour  would likely have you making more. Plus what about overtime.

Maybe they will try to keep you but will they be willing to pay you. They have a great set up( for themselves).

1.They should pay per hour, then you would get over time.

2. They should pay over the table and absorb some of the tax burden. So you can rent or buy a house. Plus, be able to get unemployment should they have to move or if they let you go.

3. Why should you have to watch anyone's children 10 days in a row when they have two parents.

This is so messed up. Why would they not want to give you a w2? Probably as a tax shelter of sorts and because they might be getting a tax break for how they report your income.  And to top it off they get you to take care of their kids for 10 days at a time, for cheap.

A nanny making 25 hr makes 50k a year for 40 hours a week.  I bet if they paid you over time you would make more than 60k. You should figure out how much you make  if they gave you a w2 versus how much you make without one then find a job that is comparable. With your education you can pull in 25-30.an hour typical.  If you are truly making 60k a year your weekly pay should be 1153 on weeks there is not any over time.

I am at the low end of  nanny pay. I was quoted 10-12 per hour.  I agreed to 10 since I was a new nanny( and dumb apparently!).  I have since got a  raise after five years that I had to ask for.

"To answer your question directly: Email Customer Support. Huge need, easy to enter that market if you can be empathetic in writing. Which based on your OP, I think you can be.

It doesn't matter how much your first job pays. So long as you can survive on the pay, take what you can get. Start accumulating experience and hone your craft. Stick with each company for at least six months so they get their money's worth out of you, then up your pay rate by 50% for each new contract you find with a new company. You are effectively giving yourself a pay raise every six months.

Most platforms track your performance and time spent on contracts (e.g. Upwork). So every hour you spend working makes you that much more valuable/reliable in the market. It's an accumulating snowball effect.

They key is to start applying for new positions with a 30%-50% pay increase after 3-6 months, no matter how well it's going at your current job. Rinse, repeat, repeat, repeat.

1.5 \* 1.5 \* 1.5 \* 1.5 = 500% increase. If that's not fast enough for you, try doubling your pay. If it's too fast, only give yourself a 20% pay increase.

There is a huge misconception that **all** clients are always trying to hire the absolute cheapest person who submits an application. There are indeed *some* clients like this, but you definitely **do not want to be hired by them**. There are also clients who actually need real, quality work done and have a reasonable budget to work with. Some clients would never even **consider** hiring someone who is charging under $10 for quality English interactions / support / writing / etc. Why? Maybe because they've tried 3 or 4 times to hire someone at $5 per hour, and each time they had a very bad experience and feel like it's a waste of their time. Who knows, they may be turning around and billing your time to their customers at 2x or 3x what you are charging them. $10 or $15 per hour could be pocket change in their eyes when what they really need is quality.

Ideally you'll want to spend some time setting up a system that monitors job postings 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and sends you notifications when a posting appears that meets your requirements. Then let that system run for a few weeks or a few months. You'll have plenty of time to let it run if you already have a job that pays the bills and you are not desperate.

"&lt;The Heart of a Golem&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

?What happened?? I fell to my knees. The dust scraped against my knees like an axe on a whetstone.
  
?The men tore down the forests for supplies. We took root within you, your magic providing sustenance. Giving us life. We can work together to restore the forest.? The sapling on my chest twisted and turned to look at me in the eyes. 
  
?Get out of my face,? I said as I swatted at the sapling.
  
?Look. Everything I swore to protect has been destroyed. There is no forest left.? I spread my arms in exasperation. Though small hills and valleys were in the way, there was no sign of anything for as far as I could see. ?If you guys are so desperate to fix the forest, why don?t you just replant yourselves??
  
?That won?t work. That won?t work,? the one on my chest muttered hurriedly. One of the ones on my arm craned around to face me ?See we were born of your magic, should we leave your body we would surely die within a short amount of time. Sadly there are also no nutrients left in the ground for our offspring to feed upon also. Hence why we need your help.? I jumped back.
  
?Wait? you don?t have faces or mouths? how are you talking to me??
  
?We thought you would have realised! Due to being tapped into your magic we can speak with your mind directly!? All five of the saplings seemed to nod their limbs in agreement.
  
?How is this even possible??
  
?We are unsure. Neither were the elders. Their best guess was to do with your creation, since you are made from nature, your connection to it is very strong.? My creation? I couldn?t remember how I?d come to be. I had just woken up one day.
  
?Who are these elders? You?ve mentioned them before, should I know them??
  
?They?re the old trees. The wise ones. We were connected to them while you slumbered. They were carved out many moons ago now. We have been on our own. Sitting in silence. Waiting for you to awake again.?
  
?Right. What makes you think I?ll help??
  
?The trees told us of your past and where you came from. They have watched you for hundreds of years. Through generations of younglings. You are a hero.? I shook my head vigorously, a few leaves floating to the ground from the saplings. 
  
?I?m no hero. I haven?t ever done anything heroic. I was made to bring destruction.? I kicked at the ground. ?I couldn?t even do that right.? I stared ahead as the sun began to set. Wandering the wasteland seemed more inviting than ever. Maybe one day the magic would run out and I would be allowed to rest. Permanently.
  
?But you saved the forest for countless generations of the young.? The saplings all nodded their heads in agreement. I rolled my eyes and continued to trudge along aimlessly. ?The elders heard of your tales for many moons. The golem who would stop the men tearing down the trees. You were a hero to many!?
  
?Yea right. If I was really a hero there would still be plants. I was made to destroy and I sure as hell never saved anything.? The saplings tried to speak, but I simply told them to shut up. The sand and dust below me crunched as I walked. I didn?t know how long I walked. I didn?t track the cycle of the stars in the sky as they vanished and reappeared many a time. I simply walked. Then I picked up a faint trickle. Fainter than a whisper, from somewhere nearby. I followed the sound, as it gently grew louder to find a cave where a small stream of water gently fell from the roof.

You need to provide a source for the claim that O66 is short term, as there?s direct canon sources that say it?s permanent, and you need to provide another for the idea of the ?safety? override, because, again?there?s no canon support for it and plenty of things that point to it not existing.

"Once again, I think it's a case to case basis. I think you have to look at the individual to see whether or not they still have violent behavior in prison as well as the propensity to be rehabilitated. I also think the age speaks volumes. Kinkel was 15 when he committed this crime. It has been over 20 years since the shooting. While he has been in prison he has shown a willingness to participate in the community there as well as take any semblance of responsibility he can. People can grow and change in spite of their mistakes. Kinkel has showed a willingness to change and I think he has prospered with the support system he's utilized. If he were to be released I have faith he could function in the free world with a heavily structured life. If a system soley equates someone to their crimes and see them as nothing but throwaways in spite of their progress while incarcerated that is a failed system in my opinion. Or a system that is heavily flawed.",generic_singularthey

I don?t think Daniel Son would be able to beat Johnny with the Crain kick if he tried it again, Johnny would dodge it and sweep the leg.  Believing this still doesn?t stop me from getting super excited every time I see the numbers surge in the chain, hoping for a repeat of Jan to happen and launch us, cause I could definitely be wrong.  I?m not suggesting ppl don?t trade options, one of these weeks it WILL pop and tendies will be great for the calls, can?t wait for it.  I haven?t done the math, but it?s possible buying these calls each week may actually be a less expensive strategy to get a high volume of shares in the long run, even if you take a loss for several weeks?but the fact remains if they hit max pain end of day on Friday, they won the battle for that week and they live to fight another day.

Everyone's gotta be 18+

Hey! I'm here tryna do a snuff rp several characters from The Last Airbender or Korra. Obviously all set many years after the original shows for reasons.

I have some plots here but feel free to bring your own. Personally I prefer playing the victim but I am opening to switching.

A Diplomatic Dinner: Azula has been locked away from anything political for a while, she's been stuck on house arrest for years since the war ended. However, Zuko asked if she wanted to attend a dinner, an important dinner. The most important dinner possibly in all of Fire Nation so she instantly agrees, unfortunately for Azula though, she didn't realise until the night of that she wasn't an attendee, she was the meal... This rp would be a dolcett one, having Azula being cooked and eaten by Zuko, Sokka, Katara, Etc. As they talk casually about the terms of a new agreement. Azula can be precooked or she can be BBQ'd on the day. Listening to them talk as the carve off one of her tits to eat.

Aang's Revenge: The avatar was still bitter over his death at Azula's hands, he ensured one of the terms of the fire nations surrender was handing Azula over to him and it was finally time to take his revenge.

Mai &amp; Ty Lee's game night: Azula's lost at the hands of Katara and Zuko left her vulnerable, at her lowest she turned to Mai and Ty Lee, begging for their sympathy. So they took her in, hid her away from the world, now that the search has ended and she was presumed dead, they could take out all that residual anger in her in a series of torturous games culminating in her very overdue demise.

Ozai's Angel: Ozai knew how his daughter schemed and plotted his demise. He saw the look in her eyes, ever since the war ended it was a countdown. So he decided to take action, and eliminate the threat. (Maybe with Zuko's help?)

Toph's final fight: Toph had made a name for herself after the war, underground wrestling. Where she made her name in the first place. She could knock out anyone in the first round, but it seems she'd finally met her match.

The punishment of a lifetime: This could fit nearly any character, they've been captured, and their punishment is a lifetime of sex slavery, unfortunately this life won't last much longer.

In need of a humbling: Fire lord Azula/Zuko has been abusing their power recently, they acted too much like Sozin. So intervention was taken, either by the people of the FN, Aang, or the whole gaang. Not dissimilar to our own French Revolution. They were dragged out into the public square, humiliated, and fucked until they died. And then for a bit longer too.

A Mother's Revenge: Ursa returned to the fire nation, finding Azula as infuriating as ever. Be she a fire lord or a prisoner. It started as a punishment, some light spanking, but as time went on Ursa truly realised what a monster Azula was, and how she couldn't be left to live any longer.

Water extinguishes fire: Azula had a last minute change of sides, she left with Zuko after the war but she didn't change like he did. The only thing about her that changed was her allegiances, not her morals or principles. Katara knew this more than anyone with how much Azula joked about her mother's death. So Katara decided that Azula should get acquainted with death, though when the moment came she didn't hold back like she intended to, and Azula didn't come back up.

Stranded at sea: two of our characters get stranded in the middle of the ocean, no land in sight. It could be katara/Sokka, Aang/katara, Aang/Sokka, Suki/Sokka, Azula/Sokka, Azula/Zuko, Azula/Mai/Ty Lee, etc. And days have passed. The two grow hungrier but only one of them will live to see the morning, not after getting their sexual desires tended too first of course.

No limits on my end, the less you have the better! I enjoy playing with more extreme kinks before the murder is done. We can do multiple prompts too, maybe combine ideas and have a character go in a sort of killing spree.

"I think people are really forgetting why Evolve died. It wasn't DLCs, shitty monetization practices or anything like that. This game just wasn't fun and wasn't good. At first during beta and after release matches were going on for too long. It was too easy to run away as a monster and stall game until you level up. So they made some changes to speed up the game, but problem is this game wasn't designed around faster matches so balance became an even bigger issue. And when we talk about balance... it was non existent. Anyone remember how OP, to a point it was simply broken, Wraith was? Then they nerfed him to the ground, then made him viable again with buffs, but after nerfs people rarely picked him since Kraken became #1 pick.

I played this game on both sides, played it during beta, after release, after hunt 2.0 and after it went F2P. It was always same problem. If a competent player played as monster and picked viable monster (Kraken, Goliath, pre-nerf Wraith or post buffs/rework) then for hunters whole match turned into running around the map, only occasionally seeing monster until it leveled up and then just stomped them easily. Like seriously, if monster player was a little competent then this game ALWAYS looked like this: monster player runs around leveling up, it's boring both for monster and hunters. Monster finally reaches max level and just stomps hunters.",plural_they
"&gt;I disagree with that because the villain turned hero is usually the mostpopular character on a show see zuko, the green ranger and so on. Plusbeing good and being sassy aren't te same thing.

Eh; I agree more with Halabackgirl.  I am going to admit I've never seen any incarnation of Power Rangers or Avatar, and there's a good chance that here I'm in the great minority for that, but I've seen plenty of children's media wherein a character starts out bad, gets redeemed, and then either vanishes or might as well have vanished since what passes for that character post-redemption is a totally new one.  I'm going to assume that this is because writers don't really like writing characters with depth; especially in children's media.  Writing characters who can function as both villains and heroes requires a sort of common trait that can work in both roles, and since a lot of fictional villains don't have a whole lot of depth beyond their villainy, redeeming them doesn't leave them with any distinguishing characteristics.

Take, for example, Mr Grinch.  His entire character upon introduction is that he hates Christmas.  His original story ends shortly after he stops hating Christmas.  They could keep using him post-redemption but only by writing in new traits that he never showed before.  It's different when you have a character like Jack Skelington; he nearly wrecks everything because his perspective is so warped, but at all points you get an insight into his character as desiring far more than to wreck things, and generally being actually pretty nice and upbeat.  So after going out and correcting his error Jack doesn't become a completely different character.  He's changed, but the change he went through is one you would expect him to based on the sort of person he was immediately established to be.

The problem is that they established Chloe as more like the Grinch than Jack Skelington.  In fact, they established her right into the ground.  The one thing Chloe has going for her being a superhero is that she likes superheroes, but not on any greater level than did Syndrome from *The Incredibles*.  In other words, Chloe likes superheroes because she likes power.  She likes the feeling of being able to affect things on a big level, but as with Syndrome, she lacks the empathy to use power responsibly and the moment she gets it she nearly kills a bunch of people.  Writers could still redeem Chloe, but the big question is, ""If they did, would she still be Chloe?  If so, how?""  That's not necessarily rhetorical but do you have an answer?  What does she have going for her personality as a trait that still works after she is redeemed?",plural_they

Before my trip I made sure to put some background music to not loose complete touch to reality, though it really just [incremented](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfoieUypTKU) the trip, I could feel the music in my bones while the lamp in my ceiling was  flowering with beautiful glowing eyes all looking at me while multiple mouths' where making sounds I can't express with words,  opening and clothing at a stupid speed. There were little people grabbing hands and spinning all around me, everywhere I looked, I wanted to dance with them but I was too damn high to even sit right. Eventually I was able to (kind of) stand up and get some water and food, while eating I realized I could see some kind of network of matter, I still can't find the right words to describe this, but it was as if everything was connected with veins, there was a tiny fruit fly by me and I could see the air around it moving, I was completely in awe by this so I decided to look outside my window, literally everything was wrapped in this network, I need to know if this is a common thing to see with phycobilin, if anybody here knows what I'm talking about please let me know how it looked for you. After 4 hours I got to my computer chair and saw the beautiful music video played, all I can say is that I wish my eyes could see it how it looked like forever. I saw some messages from my dad checking on me, and I could barely respond anything, I got too caught up on thought every time I tried to come up with a reply, not only that but the text was so wiggly and coated in beautiful rainbow colors, it was too distracting to reply. After that I started to come down and realized it was almost 5 PM, so I tried to make some lunch which I barely succeeded at.

I watched over 200 days of riots live streaming on twitch and YouTube for the majority of my evenings in 2020.

The majority of the feeds from independent primarily leftist sources, like woke on twitch or unicorn riot and various other groups filming live on the ground during the hundreds of riots. 

So many riots where happening simultaneously  where they could be viewed a live mashup on wokes twitch feed, it was pretty crazy to watch.

Oddly enough can you guess what I learned from this event? and which mainstream garbage network was covering it?, while others like cnn had headlines like  ?a fiery mostly peaceful protest? ?


This is where I learned as shitty as fox is, they where showing all the things related to the riots that CNN, NBC, CBS and all the other mainstream networks where not showing. 

I don?t rely on any of these sources btw I just like seeing the variance in what everyone in their group is saying, while primarily trying to seek out the raw data to determine for myself what is the truth. 

So for more than 200 days I watched over 2 billion worth of property damage occur, many lives lost and small businesses destroyed and blm was at all of those events, are you trying to say that didn?t happen?

Because If that?s what you are saying, then you have absolutely no fucking clue about what?s ?really? going on.

[BLM + Antifa Marching Chanting Death to America ](https://youtu.be/3zTZ1SA10Ks)

[CNN SHOWING FIERY BUT PEACEFUL PROTESTS LOL](https://youtu.be/LKrL9GO1JuA)

Blm May have started with good intentions but their leadership and funding is all over the place and it has morphed into a new monster that does more harm than good.

BLM quite often marching around blocking roads, vandalizing property chanting about killing cops, most the one I saw most recently during a rally chanting pigs in a blanket fry like bacon, 

They have damaged and burned both black and white small businesses during marches.

BLM constantly lies about statistics and misleads people into a greater racial divide, they are definitely not creating less racism in this world. 

They encourage behavior that will lead to more people having violent/dangerous altercations with police. 

By perpetuating the lie that racist police are constantly hunting down and killing black people everywhere for no reason.

Their dangerous rhetoric has resulted in attacks on police, white people and trump supporters. 

They recently pushed a boycott of white owned businesses during the holidays. Black Xmas put and end to white capitalism.....#buyblack. 

The leaders have asked for white people to pay them reparations for the suffering of their ancestors.

They act like police brutality is only a problem when it happens to black folks, but ignore when it happens to others.

They have lied multiple times about ? completely innocent people gunned downed racist cops for the crime being black? 

When in many of these incidences the person was fighting cops, grabbing a cops gun, pulling out a gun on a cop, failing to drop a weapon or otherwise engaging in behavior that statistically leads to cops pulling their guns out.

I?m not making this stuff up they are just another racist hate group judging from
Their actions and statements I have seen them make, all of which has been been recorded and can be verified in the Information Age.

Blm says black lives Matter yet the organization only focuses on 0.001% of black deaths! 

The leaders of the movement are self described ?trained [MARXISTS](https://youtu.be/rdpIIiBe7Wc)?, they plan to ?recruit? over 600 leaders and make ?chapters? in most major cities around the world.

Ironically Their Marxist leader Patrisse Cullors Just purchased multi million dollar homes with money she made from her activism, is now distancing herself from
The organization because of all the criticism she has drawn to the group.

The movement claims to not have leadership when convenient, but the self professed chapter and movement leaders love to boast about their accomplishments.

But when the leaders of various chapters as in Canada make racist tweets about killing white people.

This news gets quickly swept under the rug. 

We got BLM talking heads like Sean King saying we need to abolish white Jesus.

On the BLM website https://blacklivesmatter.com/what-we-believe/
Where the Marxist ideology expands into the ideals of transactionality.

Below is a quote from the above BLM website (BEFORE IT WAS EDITED DUE TO CONTROVERSY)about how they feel about the nuclear family,(cults thrive on disrupting the family and creating a new cult family)

We disrupt the Western-prescribed nuclear family structure requirement by supporting each other as extended families and ?villages? that collectively care for one another, especially our children, to the degree that mothers, parents, and children are comfortable.
We foster a queer?affirming network. When we gather, we do so with the intention of freeing ourselves from the tight grip of heteronormative thinking, or rather, the belief that all in the world are heterosexual (unless s/he or they disclose otherwise).

Now their website has a whole bunch of demands like permanently banning from government and all media the political figures they disagree with.

BLM encourages the pushing away or disdain against people in their family and social groups who do not follow the same group think.

BLM takes ?charitable? donations, much of which go toward funding Democratic Party candidates through ActBlue, despite most of the city?s with the most unrest being run by Democratic Party majorities. 

If you goto I a BLM rally with a MAGA hat or American flag, or say you support the police, it is almost guaranteed that you will be called a nazi white supremacist verbally and physically attacked for your unacceptable beliefs even if you happen to be a person of color.

The BLM cult CLENCHED FIST symbol is identical to the Red salute symbol of the communist party, is being flaunted everywhere, on T-shirt?s, signs flags, stickers, the BLM graffiti sprayed everywhere on public and government property, even now being adopted by large corporations pandering to the mob.

BLM justifies violence, racism and destruction of public and government property if it results in accomplishing the Marxist intersectional anti white goals of the organization. 

People who speak against the BLM narrative including former members of the organization are doxxed, businesses burned, cancelled chastised and publicly shamed. 

So like a cult they are guilty of attempts in silencing any descent of the movement. 

The BLM movement thrives through pushing an us and them mentality. 

It?s mind blowing that so many people blindly and righteously support this group.",mixed_they

My dog is generally good with other dogs but is very anxious and I could easily see him becoming dog reactive if he does have a negative interaction with another dog. The other day two dogs escaped a house as their owner was opening the front door. Fine I get it it happens. They approach, hackles raised, but stop as I stand my ground and loudly tell them ?no!?. Their owner just stands on the porch and then when I ask them to get their dogs they send out their kids?no older than 11 to come wrangle in these huge dogs. Which they do by just saying ?treat? over and over for about a minute and a half as opposed to physically grabbing them.

A Junkrat can rain grenades on them from a safe position above.  A good general rule is to jump them from a corner or from above, minimising the sight lines and time the Bastion has to shoot you.

"If you want to attempt to save it, you are going to have to cut it up and change the soil (and probably pot too, that one looks too large). I just went through something similar with mine, except the trunk was not mushy.

If I was there, with you, I would cut that long branch off with the nice leaves on the end. It will be its own new plant now, and I think it will do well. I am assuming you know how to prop if this was a clipping to begin with, although I would like to suggest getting a small terracotta pot with a drainage hole for it to help the soil dry out. (also, recently I have been using Black Gold succulent and cactus potting soil, and for bagged succulent soil it already has a lot of perlite in it and I thought it worked well for propping. But my baby jade clippings in terracotta and regular potting soil are doing just fine as well)

Next, I would cut the floppy branch above it off. From the video, I could not tell if the stem looked good enough to use, but you could prop those leaves! Just be patient, mine took FOREVER to sprout.

Now, for the really painful part - you should really consider cutting the top off. I do not think this plant has much chance of making it unless you force it into survival mode, and cutting the top off could do this. My only concern is it might not have enough leaves. I was thinking cut it below the node where the long branch was growing, and above that tiny thing that I am hoping are little leaves. I cut mine up a lot, more than the recommended rule of ""don't cut more than 1/3 of the leaves off your plant"" or whatever, I cut off like half of my jade that was like yours. Same species, too. Anyway, if you cut the top off, and then change the pot (terracotta with drainage hole is your friend if you have trouble with watering) and soil, it could just work. (Also, you might be able to dry out the top and eventually stick it in dirt and see if it roots - idk but it might be a fun experiment!)

Now that the floppy parts are off, I would take it out of the soil and \*carefully\* loosen the root ball and gently knock off the soil if it is damp. I think its been sitting in wet soil too long, like everyone else has suggested. Then check the roots for signs of root rot (brown, mushy roots, a foul smell) and hopefully that is not the case. If it has root rot, carefully cut the rotten roots off with sterile clippers.

I am betting it does not have a very large root ball, so if you put it in a new pot, don't get a pot that is too large because that can lead to the soil staying moist for too long. Just my guess but you may only need like a 6"" pot max. (You could probably literally take it out of its pot, figure out how big its root ball is, and then leave it somewhere safe to dry while you go to the store to get an appropriate sized pot for its root ball if you are unsure. Recently I have gotten all my terracotta pots with drainage holes from Walmart lol)

I wrote all of this because I have seriously been there. I got clippings from my grandmothers large dying jade plant after she passed away because nobody was taking care of it. I did not know how to properly take care of it at first, and mine became etiolated like yours, too. I got tired of propping it up, so I cut it up about a month ago, and now I have a ton of teeny tiny leaves shooting out at many of the nodes!

Also, because everyone keeps mentioning that it doesn't like to be kept in moist soil, I was wondering if you knew to feel the jade leaves to tell if it needs watering? If they feel firm, they do not need water, but if they start to get squishy, then you can water it :)",plural_they

The ar15 has no close quarters ability? The m4? The mk18? Those short barrels? Definitely not useful for cqc. Older weapons that easily have a 20 plus inch barrel would do better of coooourse they would. Cuz who wants a compact package.

I dont know what he thinks is a cheap gun but you can easily get an ar15 for 500-800 bucks. Sometimes even 300. It is America's rifle and it is everywhere. Aside from hunting bolt guns, shotguns, and a few other surplus weapons your gonna be paying a decent bit of money.
Basically, money isnt the problem.

The AR15 is a great tool for small game.

"Me too, one of these days we may find out. The thing is, within evil there is no universal love and brotherhood. It is fear that drives the show. Evil will always hate those amongst themselves, as evil's greatest trick is convincing it's host that it is in fact good, or at least better comparatively than those surrounding it. You will find that the first to throw stones are those with closets filled with skeletons.

There seems to be different branches of ideas under the greater demonic system. Different world views on what it all means. People ask all the time why God tolerates such a wicked force, but I can see why. Without this universal bind, they would be at eachothers throats, and they'd all be nothing but ash and rubble within mere hours. It is only through a far greater foe there is any sense of connective nature. 

There are those who under such systems actually enjoy the freedom it awards and as such celebrate what they do to achieve said freedom, and those who are still willing to do it but believe themselves to be different, just trapped, and not the evil that surrounds them. So there is division. Then there are those who are religious. 

I think the most important thing to note is that nobody operates on a hive mind. Donald Trump was clearly something they were not, but that does NOT mean he avoided the system. It is absolutely impossible, based on what he has achieved and what is known, that he avoided all of it. You do not reach such positions without a direct sign off from the Dark Hand itself, period. Well, at least, until the return. That's what I believe, but you know what? don't take this as information, its my belief. Its different than other things I put out there and it is certainly subject to change as I too learn more and hone in on my own set of beliefs that make me make sense of the mad, mad world in which we live.",plural_they

"This will probably be controversial, but here it goes anyway.  I think that there's sort of cognitive dissonance experienced by people into NSFW lolis.  For non-pedophiles, sexualizing children is seen as disgusting and immoral.  But, since lolis are unrealistic and may have some adult features, non-pedophile lolicons are strongly motivated to focus on these features to prove that it's not a child, so they haven't violated their moral principles.  Perhaps it's wishful thinking.  This is why you may see lolis as children, while lolicons do not; what you choose to focus on is different.  For example, if someone wanted to sexualize Kanna from Dragon Maid then they would focus on her large thighs, while ignoring her childish personality.  Personally, I find this whole thing very confusing and stressful, so I try to stay away NSFW lolis.  Others here may be less stressed when it comes to this stuff.",generic_singularthey

Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion).

"Dugin internalized enlightenment values, his national bolshevism, and now seems to be returning to classical reactionary creeds, against good old conservatives like burke and hume (who more and more sound like liberals to our ears). He's a de Maistre fascist, and he is mixing old believer Russian orthodoxy with guenon and Evola, a potent fascism indeed. On the second point, I draw attention to these currents because they deserve to be known. If this is construed as promotion I can only say I dont hold people's judgement in such contempt. The myth of bad majorities is also a reactionary one. Ortega Y Gasset's revolt of the masses paints such a view, but conservatives always overestimate their own influence. That is why they pour so much money into their pathetic think tanks. The left doesn't even need to try to influence ideology because history is always on its side. The rise of fascism is a sign of a failed revolution, so any reactionary creed is also the sign of an opportunity to do away with barbarism in the form of democratic plutocracy and oligopoly. It is true I have something of an obsession with Traditionalism in general and that is because it provides answers, the wrong ones, to current social and political aporia that illuminate much more consicely the kinds of questions that the left should he raising.

"I made this reply to a now-deleted comment of OP's that claimed that ""rigging"" was not a case of editorializing. They claimed that the source for this rigging was from the wikileaks leaked DNC emails:

Yes, calling it rigged is editorializing. Actually, at this point I'd call it *lying*. There is zero evidence to justify that claim. Do you know that the DNC doesn't run elections? It's a by-state election system. How can you rig that over which you have no power? You can't, it's nonsensical, and it's something I never see addressed (the *how* it was allegedly rigged).

The 'emails' show worrying conflicts of interest (Clinton had bailed them out recently) and unfair behavior during the debates (by far the worst thing to come from them IMO). They also show unprofessional behavior with respect to the organization having a strong personal preference toward Clinton (not exactly surprising though, considering Sanders wasn't a Democrat until his Presidential run).

But honestly, they were more inappropriate to other Democrats by clearing the field for Clinton during the invisible primary. Sanders actually benefited from their actions more than anything else, because all of the anti-Clinton vote unified around him. In 2020, without that, his support is much lower.

None of that is rigging an election. Their actions may have had subtle impacts, but the votes everyone cast in the actual primary weren't changed. What occurred in NC 9th district last election is what rigging looks like, or what dictatorships do. 

And this 'article' of yours is completely unjustified as well. Where is the actual study? What was their methodology? Because what I'm seeing is them saying ""hey, Clinton got more votes in paper trail voting primaries!"". Never mind that there were only 31 primaries, it's entirely possible that those primaries that Clinton happened to do well in happened to have a paper trail by chance. This piece is the exact sort of hack job that is not welcome on this subreddit.

In fact, my hypothesis would be that states in which Clinton performed well, diverse states and southern states, are some of the poorest in the country and might not have their elections well executed.",plural_they

Because it's not.  **Maybe you should try living in a country where the civil right leaders were successful by preaching compassion and understanding towards people who hate you.**  They were intolerant, but not hateful about it.   You and this sub are just being hateful.  

You can be intolerant of an idea without hate, like incels, by saying let's figure out a way to get these folks mental health counseling.  They are people who feel isolated and unloved by society, let's figure out how they got to that point.  You have to try and understand things you don't like if you ever want to find a solution to the problem.   Ever yell at a scared, angry dog and it calm down?

They did NOT want national reporting on dozens of bodies being found in their city. They didn't want people leaving, or moving to other cities.

This unfortunately happens constantly - and it's understandable, so to speak - no town wants to be known for serial anything, which is why so much crime goes unreported on. Houston in this regard was no exception.

So there are bodies still buried, and nobody will look for them, because case closed and the guy is dead and Houston doesn't need to stain their newfound rep with serial killer nonsense.

&gt; **The Smallest TL;DR I feel to give:** Drunk Driver driving w/o a license hit my car a few years back. He got cited with like five different things and I with nothing.  He apparently filed an insurance claim against me, lied entirely and said he was a pedestrian and I struck him. They believed him/paid him out more money than I've made my entire life. I was never told this and never had a rate increase.  I just got a new rep who saw this and FUCKING &gt;&gt;TRIPLED&lt;&lt; my insurance rates because I am now a dangerous driver I guess.  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt; Details: I was making a delivery, in my person vehicle, at probably 10:30 three years ago. I was making a left-hand turn on an arrow and some one struck my passenger-side rear door. It was a drunk-man on a bicycle which had been modified with a small 2-stroke engine.   
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Some on-lookers called the police and such blah blah, and he was basically intoxicated at the time, and driving with a suspended license from previous drunk driving charges. He **lied** to the police and told them he was just walking across the street that I'd have been turning on-to and that I struck him.   
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; This was an obvious lie as there where actually impact-marks on the rear-passenger side. All the police on scene (This is a weird intersection where they were trying to figure out jurisdiction, so there were actually at least seven/eight officers there) completely agreed that this was impossible and that my recount was correct. They took him to the hospital and then the jailhouse on multiple citations/charges.  
&gt; Driving with a suspended license  
&gt; Driving while under the influence  
&gt; Lying to the police/obstruction  
&gt; Reckless endangerment  
&gt; Driving without insurance  
&gt; I know these since I was on a delivery at the time so the company had to check the reports to make sure I could still perform my job, even they all-cleared me.  
&gt; While I got charged with absolutely nothing, not even points on my license, and my insurance did not increase my rates at the time, they were informed, by me and the police.  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Whatever rep handled my account has switched and been replaced I guess... but I went to pay my part of the bill for the last month only to find out that it had ***god-fucking-damn TRIPLED, T-R-I-P-L-E-D.*** I obviously called them up about it, and the new rep gave me some sass and pretty much told me that it was only expected since I'd 'had so many accidents the past few years.'   
&gt; This is the only incident that even comes close to an accident that I've ever been involved in, even as a passenger. I told her this and then she fed me a line about how this was a very serious accident though, since I ***apparently hit a pedestrian who was paid out multiple tens-of-thousands-of-dollars.***  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; It's extremely obvious that this man must have fed the same bullshit story to my insurance... and they actually bought it and are now trying to pass on their expense to me.  
&gt; Is there anything I can do to refute this or am I just bending over and taking it... this is literally the difference between having to change my life's-schedule by a few years and maybe finding a new job. I have access to the police reports.  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; On a side question, since I'm the most spiteful person I know: Can I ruin this man's life by exposing his insurance fraud?

"I doubt they'll be more awkward. Have a read up on your rights as a tenant. Chances are, if the agent realises that you actually know your stuff, they're not gonna mess you about like a typical personal who doesn't know much. It's your legal right to know.

You can make a written request to your agent, and they then have 21 days to provide you with the information. In fact, according to Section 48 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1987, rent is not lawfully due unless you're given an address to serve your landlord notices (you can only hold rent until the information is received). Section 1 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 states that you have the right to request this information.

So quote these acts in an email, and threaten to withhold rent as you have not been provided with the landlord's name and address. If they refuse which is unlikely then you can send them a written notice and withhold rent. I doubt your agents will be awkward, you're quoting them your rights, showing them that you actually know what you're on about. I did this with a service charge and had no more problems with my agents afterwards. You also have rights regarding your deposit, so look them up and repeat the process if necessary... but I think you're overthinking it considering you haven't even asked lmao, just email or call them.",generic_singularthey

fast forward to may 2019, i went to Korea and bought a sim card; found out my phone was locked... the identical sim card worked fine on iphone 7 unlocked phone. After i got back to US, I requested verizon to unlock my phone which they claim they did

fast forward to september 2019, i went to korea again and bought another sim card for Korea. STILL didn't work. contacted verizon they claimed the phone is unlocked and should work. but it didn't...

They told me to try restore; which I did and put in the korean sim card --&gt; did not work; put in the old verizon sim card which used to work fine--&gt; does not work now.

I am now back in US with no functioning phone. How could this happen? I tried restoring last night (IOS13.1) and it still does not work. I put my sim on iphone 7 unlocked phone and it works fine....I put in another verizon sim card to my iphone x...it does not work.",plural_they

Tell me, do you know what the danger that Claude faces? Unlike others, Claude CHALLENGES religion. And in supports and dialogue, hints that such things would label him a heretic. And you know what happens to heretics? Death.

So to harm believers is not strictly limited to physical harm. And civilians aren't even armed individuals that would harm in such a manner. But if they challenge the religious dogma, they are harmful. Even if they are simply suspect.

"As an upfront disclaimer, I haven't even looked at the link/shop/chart/whatever from your post.

**However..**

Something to keep in mind is that a lot of clothing on Etsy comes from China. Sometimes it's the case of shitty resellers, but sometimes it's the case of someone who actually does design their own stuff and get it printed on shirts and such.. but the actual shirts and such come from China. So in that case you're still paying for the design itself, which is chill, but again in **many** cases the shirts themselves will be purchased wholesale/bulk from China. 

So if you've ever ordered any obviously-from-China clothing online, such as on Amazon, then you know that the sizes are going to run smaller. 

Now in typical U.S. retail outlets.. the companies may order in bulk from China for their printed designs, but they have enough agency to do their own size labels. So they might order a bunch of ""large"" shirts from China, but then have the tag actually say ""medium"" for marketing purposes. 

But a little shop on Etsy? Not so much, in most cases. Bottom line is don't worry so much about the sizing labels, but instead focus on the objective measurements given. And of course, whether you are getting a truly original design, or just something bought from China and resold with no creativity whatsoever. 

Especially as a woman, my closet contains sizes from XS to Large, for item types that all fit me the same. The label is just marketing. This is as true on Etsy as anywhere else.",plural_they

"&gt;A global problem requires global cooperation.

I completely agree. A global cooperation would necessarily entail that the United States continues to make strides in carbon emission reductions. Given that we have a rather hard time controlling the actions of other nations, however, the most *immediate* source of carbon emission reduction available to us is by controlling our own actions. This is the reality that you and I both acknowledge. Therefore, it would be irrational for a U.S. citizen to ""take their complaints to China"", but it would make sense for the U.S. government to negotiate with China. 

&gt;Global Warming is the front page of news around the world, at both a local and national level. Please dont act as if people dont realize that it is an issue.

People realizing it's an issue isn't sufficient. The question on AskReddit said: ""What do people NOT take seriously enough?"" I expect far more than people realizing it's an issue. I also expect more than regular and consistent media coverage; however, we currently have a problem where even *these* necessary (but not sufficient) requirements are not satisfactorily met. We still have large proportions of misinformation and ""climate skepticism"" in the political sphere to convince people that climate change is not an issue. This can range anywhere from: ""The climate has always been changing. There's no way to tell if the earth warming is due to human emissions."" to: ""The earth has actually been *cooling.*"". Regardless of where the skepticism lies, they all have one thing in common: rejection of policies or global cooperative initiatives to deal with climate change (e.g. rejection of carbon taxes or the Paris Agreement). 

That aside, it is not enough to merely recognize climate change as an issue to take it seriously. I would expect that, if people took it seriously, they'd be more willing to make changes in their personal lives to reduce environmental impact. I do not mean changes like giving up straws. I mean changes like going vegetarian or vegan. Alternatively, they should be at least willing to bear a greater burden in taxes to fund initiatives to fight climate change.

Of course, most people do not take climate change that seriously. Why? Because most people have bigger problems to worry about. They need to pay their bills. They have a medical emergency. They need to get by in their day-to-day lives. Combine this with the misinformation surrounding climate change, and your average person might agree it's an issue, but that's pretty much it. Climate change might not even be a significant issue they consider when deciding who to vote for. 

&gt;It is the corporations and businesses.

Corporations and businesses determine production based off demand for their product. A larger population correlates with larger demand. Then population is not a false flag.

Further, to my knowledge, companies in China often produce products for other countries that outsource labor or manufacturing. How should this be counted? Shouldn't there be significant responsibilities from both parties involved? Or is the country that outsourced their labor and manufacturing able to wipe their hands and claim that none of the carbon emissions are their fault? 

&gt;Btw, there are several other countries besides the US which contribute to climate change more, and do far less.

In terms of carbon emissions, or are you referring to total pollutants? As far as I'm aware, China is first in carbon emissions with the U.S. in second. Who is in-between?

&gt;DOUBLE ALSO, the reason why people should go to China's door step about this, is because they arent doing ANYTHING about it. Not a single thing. That needs to change ASAP.

Supposing this is true, how does this counter those that protest in America that the U.S. ought to do more? It seems we both agree the U.S. needs to continue to do more. Perhaps you want more people to attack China? This doesn't seem to accomplish as much in my view.",plural_they

"My head of sixth form who was driven by her own ambition rather than her students who she made it clear she didn't give a shit about. She was in charge of 50-60 girls between 16-18 years old at a well respected private girls boarding school which prided itself on pastoral care. She had maybe four or five favourites in the 50 or so of us and didn't give a shit about anyone else. I was one of her most hated students. I had a bad school record but survived because I did fairly well in exams and got the qualifications to keep moving up excelling in languages where the department spotted me early on and mentored and groomed me from very early on prepping me to one day become an a level languages student and then eventually to study them at university (which I do now). I'd been at the school since I was 11 years old and had built up great relationships with most of my teachers and my classmates built on mutual trust and respect that I'd spent years building. But I never trusted her.  To her all that mattered was our grades and university applications because they made her look good not her students' mental health, not their struggles or problems not anything we were grade machines. She called one of my closest friends for the last 5 years a bad influence and tried to forbid her from talking to me (ok between us we had the worst school records but it was a bit late considering she was a year older and about to leave), isolate me from my classmates by telling me I had to work in the library and couldn't sit with my friends at lunch because of issues with one girl, when my mental health went on a downward spiral she ignored the staff and my friends all of whom had known me for years who were all telling her for quite a while they were really worried (ended up having a serious breakdown and once again she ignored it leaving everyone else to help pick up the pieces and the languages department literally staged their own intervention because they were fed up of waiting for her to do something and along with her deputy I got back on track within a week because none of them let me out of their sight if they could help it). My year group was also the best we leaned on each other and got each other through it. At the start of our last year we made a pact that we'd all get to the finish line together not leaving anyone behind and that we'd do what we could to get us all there. This led to a 'we're all in this shit together' and one for all and all for one sort of attitude and when one person was going through tough times everyone would surround them and help only asking teachers to step in during absolute emergencies. I love those girls we were a family and honestly if I could've taken them with me to university I'd have done it in a heartbeat because I'm certain we'd all have an amazing time. I'd still do anything for those girls and I know that if I ever need any of them all I need to do is text our group chat. We were a big mix of different personalities with big extroverts and also quiet people but something about us worked and we are all still great friends (on results day when everyone's university places got confirmed and people put on facebook 'started studying at....' everybody without prompting commented on each others including mine saying 'yesss girl', 'I knew you'd do it' and 'the qweeeeen' even if we weren't that close I know it made my day reading so many comments from my classmates so I did the same for everybody else). They will always be my girls no matter what and I couldn't have wished for a better group to go through it all with

She made those two years living hell for me and made me hate the school and clouded my view of it which was sad because the first five years there were good and happy with some very supportive and amazing heads of year (I had one from year 9-11 and he was one of the best and most supportive teachers I've ever had but unfortunately he moved back to Australia when we moved into sixth form). I wasn't the only person to be hurt by her actions and hate her. In fact far from it she's chasing people away from staying for sixth form (this year out of a year group of 53 potential sixth formers only 15 chose to stay whereas in my year group which we moved to sixth form a year after she joined so no one really knew much about her or her wrath yet so 30 out of 49 stayed). Fortunately her deputy was a godsend.  She was my tutor for the year and a half before I moved into sixth form where she moved up with us as a tutor (the groups mixed around and I was actually put in a different group with another teacher who I knew fairly well and was originally the deputy) but got promoted to deputy head of sixth form a few months in. She saved me because honestly I think without her stepping in every time things went wrong then my sixth form experience would have been far worse and I probably would have dropped out or not left with the ok grades and university place that I did. She'd step in whenever anything went wrong for me she'd step in once even strolling into the head of sixth form's office (I'd had a row with some of my friends and had been pulled into her office as I was upset and she wanted to know what was going on not to comfort me) and just saying I already know what happened I'll take it from here. Don't get me wrong her deputy was also fairly strict and harsh on us pushing us to our limits she could make big and tough 18 year olds cry with her lectures but she'd pull us back if the pressure and stress crossed the line and went too far. But you could tell she actually cared about everyone and only wanted the best for us because she'd always come running if she ever heard that anyone was in any sort of crisis (mental breakdowns, mental health crises and floods of tears were unfortunately a regular occurrence with the pressure we were all under) doing everything she could to help. If it hadn't been for the collective effort of her, my tutor and vice principal, I wouldn't have made it through. Whereas my head of sixth form did nothing.

I graduated a year ago (results day was pretty entertaining despite me telling her and other teachers many times which university I wanted and had accepted my place at she still had it written down wrong) and I've heard from my friends still there (small school and I had friends in boarding who were two or three years younger so still there and they regularly feed me info) and she's got worse not listening to anyone and forcing students to apply for top universities they don't want to go to because if they get places there she looks good. She makes it clear that her reputation and career comes first not those she's meant to look after and support through an extremely stressful and rough time. I don't view her positively and I don't see her as my head of sixth form because I know exactly who got me through those two years and she deserves none of the credit. I went back to my school exactly one year after graduating to walk the stage one final time (our version of graduation involves the entire school with younger ones getting prizes) and not many people showed up from my year group because she'd ruined it for them and they didn't want to see her again. I went simply because I wanted to say one final thank you and goodbye to those who went above and beyond to get me through those seven years. I made a point of staying away from her and at the very beginning she tried to turn to talk to me but I deliberately opened up my programme and started staring intently at it (in it was a list of my year group and all our university destinations and I wanted to check she'd put the right one for me which she actually had) . Luckily at that moment the vice principal (I consider her my closest mentor because the pair of us were an unstoppable team for the entirety of my time at that school and she was a huge part of the reason I came back because she once told me it was her goal to get me to that day as she read out the names and wanted to read out mine) spotted me sitting in the crowd and apparently decided she couldn't wait a second longer to talk to me practically pushing her out of her way to get to me saying 'There you are OP I knew you'd make it and I've missed you more than you know you troublemaker'. Before staying with me talking and questioning me to the last minute before going on stage but not before insisting that I promise to find her afterwards so she could interrogate me some more. Luckily avoiding her was very easy as it felt like I had a little fan club to be honest because I was pulled for chats by so many teachers and there were some really emotional reunions. She tried to join in and pull me herself but it gave me so much satisfaction to just walk straight past her ignoring her each time.  Some people are not meant to be teachers and she is one of them and I'm worried because she's young (early thirties) and head of sixth form is one of the steps towards headteacher. I'm terrified that one day she'll be a headteacher. If she ever does become one I seriously pity her students.",plural_they

If there is no one in the agency that can provide it then the agency needs to pay for outside supervision.

It is completely unacceptable not to provide a new MSW graduate with someone who can assist them in clinical situations for 90 days. I would imagine that would be a massive liability. What if a patient if expressing SI and the MSW doesn't know what to do? Are they suppose to call and be billed for someone outside the agency to assist them?

And he says the way boys at school talk is awful and that the girls aren't much better. He says he would rather be alone than be around people being inappropriate or cheating.

You do realize that this is an over-simplification and generalization, right?  I was a teacher, principal and superintendent for 22 years and I've raised five kids.  Please be careful how you characterize our youth today.  They'll be taking care of us soon enough.  :)

What electives were you able to take in school compared to what is offered today?  Could you pass the end-of-course exams these kids have to bust through these days?  I certainly couldn't.  On and on.  Kids these days are doing so much more than we ever dreamed of doing, and preparing (in their own way) better for their futures.  It's not uncommon for even middle-of-the-pack kids to have college plans fleshed out before they are sophomores - unheard of in 'our' day.  They are better traveled, better read, better almost everything.  They're great, no matter what religious flavor they are.  Just because your son saw once, twice, three times another kid looking at porn on their phones, and observed cheating at the same rate, doesn't mean there is some sort of epidemic occurring or that those kids have less to offer your son.  Heck, if I was 13 years old and had a cell phone?  Katy bar the door.  And my teenage'd exploratory activities wouldn't make me less-suited to be a friend or a solid young citizen.

To be honest, in my 22-years - the kids who impressed me the most were almost always NOT members of the church unfortunately.  The top go-getters, the ones that were about to light the world on fire, the one's who were really 'with-it' - they came from the ranks of probably the ones you are referring to above (although I don't know about the cheating, but even then - lessons learned).

"The fact that he comes from southern California yet got into firearms does a lot to buck standard demographics. People from so-cal tend to be more libertarian in their viewpoints, culturally irreligious, have no significant culture of gun ownership, and are more likely to be into technology as opposed to the more traditional outdoor activities associated with guns - so when they do take up guns as their area of interest they seem to approach it differently than what we are use to seeing on youtube.

I say this having grown up there.

Karl doesn't fit your typical youtube stereotype of a southern accent only interested in blowing stuff up or a midwesterner only interested in hunting. Both Ian and Karl are more intellectual and historian in their approach, which makes them unique as shooters, because a lot of those types don't get very hands on (especially with modern stuff). They aren't like others who are more focused on the workbench of merely practical gunsmithing; but like to engage in intellectual what-if exercises, put things to the test, and talk indepth about history plus engineering.

"Personally I don't think therapy could ever possibly 'solve' any of my existential problems as an antinatalist. Nothing can.

But as someone in my late thirties I have sought impartial help through therapy a few times over the years. To me the experience of being totally honest with an objective stranger feels really good, whether they agree with me or not.

 I have been lucky enough to find a few people that I clicked with. I also had a few therapists I didn't click with at all, and that was fine, I saw them once and didn't go back.

 The main thing that therapy helps me with is that it is guilt free unloading on a person who is being paid to listen. I cannot be truly honest in my opinions with friends and family because they are at heart natalists, and i don't want to alarm or hurt them, or burden them with my angst. The therapists I have trusted and confessed my beliefs to have been understanding and didn't debate me at all.

"What I found the most lucrative was farming thundering charms off thundering exiles in arathi highlands. They are needed for a couple recipes and warriors need 8 to get their whirlwind axe. Selling them in stacks of 8 (specifically to target leveling warriors) on the AH on my server for about 4-5G. Cresting charms sold for a similar amount as well, but I found those mobs slower to kill because I'm a melee class and they apply a debuff that slows attack speed, but other classes may not have this trouble. For whatever reason burning charms only sold for like 1g for a stack of 8 on my server, so they really weren't worth it. 


I had very little competition for this spot, and I was able to farm about 16-20 thundering charms an hour, netting me somewhere around 10-12g an hour just off the thundering charms, with usually a little extra from other drops.

See this person claimed the plots when you could own as many houses as you want on one account. So one account with 8 characters could have 8 personal houses, and 8 FC houses. 

Mateus isn't a small empty server **NOW**. But back when they introduced the ""Preferred server"" system it was. The FFXIV-RP community decided that because they couldn't get new players on Balmung they would move a large section of the community to Mateus, the most empty server. 

So now Mateus exploded with players, and 2 people own an entire ward. Then, they make a tumbler post stating their style and memories are worth more than all the players looking for their own land. 

So now you can't own multiple personal houses. So they exploited the system to open a ton of FC houses.

I remember reading the general methodology for grading various positions and it seems like they did a good first pass at isolating all these variables. OL/DL grading comes to mind, as they grade individual plays on a plus (1), minus (-1), neutral (0) scale based upon play design, who wins regarding displacement, with weighted adders for TFL, sacks, blown assignments, etc. Seemed logically sound.


I?m not up to date if the state of the art is refining their current methods, or how far they are into newer models that weight grades based upon quality of opponent, advanced data tracking/analysis, but it seems like a good next step. 



Love reading how far analytics have come in these dynamic sports. Baseball has always been classic for discrete data sets but it?s good to hear about companies like EDJ Analytics. Especially how they?re spoken about in mainstream media outlets and how teams like the Eagles use their models to give situational metrics (success chance &amp; change in win %) based upon aggregate case statistics run prior to the game.

"But trans people do identify reality. The reality is that your gender identity is how you personally identify yourself while your sex describes your biological characteristics. Also, not all intersex people are ambiguous.

It accomplishes a lot. It makes them happier. Transitioning is actually a form of medical treatment.

 The suicide rate is still high because of people like you. People tend to become severely depressed when they live in a society where people are constantly calling them broken. They also have a lack of support because their friends and family will often disown them. The fact that trans people  are more likely to get murdered, sexually assaulted, become homeless, and experience descrimination doesn't help either. Their suicide rates go down when they have accepting families, have access to medical care,aren't homeless, and transition. Most of their issues are external.

"I agree that anyone going into an organization to makes changes in a video game, needs to have a practical understanding of how that video game works, including coding knowledge.    


IMO, the situation that would lead to the best possible result for the players, would be the ability to vote for 1-5 people with proven coding skills and prowess in the game as interns with a 6 month provisional employment contract, subject to renewal upon review. This would, in the very least, force CCP to have some sort of training program constantly going, with fresh blood constantly injected into the system. I think this sort of setup would create a very contentious and competitive atmosphere working at CCP, which for the light hearted just wouldnt work. And as the saying goes, the creme rises to the top.    


But, the one glaring true facts detail that will always defeat this concept is the fact that CCP is headquartered in fucking Iceland of all places, and no one in their right mind would move there to pursue a video game development career.. and when you put it like that, suddenly you realize what's been wrong with this game, all along",mixed_they

Also, she expects everybody else to make big sacrifices for the sake of her family and gets bull-headed and manipulative when they don't want to- which is also understandable because they have people to watch out for as well.

If she?s grown enough to change her gender, she can be grown enough to understand:
1) not EVERYONE has to accept her gender change with loving arms (including family members). This will never change. Some people will always be uncomfortable around trans people and you as a father have learned to accept it and that?s all that should be required of you as a father. 
2) tattoos are permanent and changing one can be a long process and in this instance, it?s unnecesarry as hell.

Throwaway account. I'm self-employed. I make about $95K/year as a YouTuber and decided a couple years ago to quit my day job and focus entirely on social media. My parents were *not* fans of this decision, to say the least. But I have my own place, my own car, pay my own bills, and I'm completely financially independent. Still, my mom constantly tells family and friends that I'm ""unemployed"" and my dad asks me when I'm going to grow up and get a real job, mostly because I take frequent trips to shoot new content for my YouTube channel. They see me as lazy. I've grown used to this criticism and I've learned to ignore it.

Anyway, more recently my grandma has been sick (not deathly ill, just some ongoing issues as she's in her 90s). My mom tells me that I need to spend the days at her place looking after her since ""you don't work."" She says it will make her (my mom) feel better if I'm spending time with Grandma. My mom even had my aunt call me and tear into me for this, which I was sort of taken off guard by. Safe to say the whole family is against me. It's true that I have the time to spend taking care of grandma, and I don't mind doing it once in a while. I feel bad because I don't want my grandma to think she's a burden. But I don't feel like I should have to do *more* than anyone else in the family just because my ""job"" is one that doesn't require me to go to work in the traditional sense.

"Pogba is the pinnacle of reactionary football. On his day, he's amazing, but that goes for just about every footballer ever. He's extremely inconsistent and can't reliably carry his team in the way that top tier players need to--Hazard, Neymar, hell even Aubameyang (intentionally excluding Messi and Ronaldo here). The truth is he's a fine player who's good to have in your squad but you simply can't build an entire team that relies on him showing up, because a lot of the time, he doesn't. 

Obviously he hasn't been helped by the torrid time Man United have been having but again, it's exactly when your team is having a torrid time that you need a world class player to come through and earn you points. Hazard, for his flaws, did that for us regularly. Pogba has not. I think this is showcased best when he plays for the French team--on his off days, he has class players around him to make up for errors or create their own chances. And then on his on days, he turns them from a great team to World Cup winners.

"Technically they should but that's not always what is seen. When we have a relapse it's not only the myelin sheath that gets damaged, the cells that repair the myelin sheath also get damaged. Therefore, over time, you might see less recovery from relapse to relapse but the symptoms that you get from the relapse is more so determined by location. However, the location of the lesion can affect the long lasting damage and recovery time as well. Typically spinal lesions and brainstem lesions are harder to recover from. Sometimes people have a relapse but they don't even notice until they get their yearly MRI because it was an asymptomatic lesion. 
Despite all this there are also disease modifying treatments that slow progression by slowing the rate that you relapse. A lot of people will say that their relapses while on the DMTs are less severe. Also prednisone can help shorten a relapse and allow you to recover faster.
My first relapse was my worst one, in my subjective opinion. I bounced back very quickly after though. Some of the first long lasting damage that was done to me happened quite early because I had five relapses that affected feeling in my legs. Since this one area was attacked so much, I have permanent damage despite that not being typical at my stage of progression. 
In my opinion, the best thing you can do is try not to worry about it. I see it as; it's my job as a patient to tell my doctors if I suspect a relapse and it's their job to track progression.",plural_they

"Getting your players to retreat on their own will is really difficult from my experience. Like you said most will make a last stand if they know they will die or they will fight thinking they will win. This is something you should let your players know session 0 or before the game starts saying combat is unforgivable and sometimes retreat is the best option and the encounter is unwinnable. The only way I've found to make players retreat is from a story/cinematic perspective rather than solely combat. What I mean by that is through description and player observations they should realize the extent of the danger they are in.  If they are present having some kind of companion NPC explicitly tell the party to run did work for me however it really depends on the player themselves. I'd say your best bet is to do a little preplanning and make sure that when the encounter comes you have a specific outcome if the players retreat or they stay and fight. So if for example your party is surrounded by bandits and you know they will die fighting and they refused to retreat and then when they reach zero hits points just knock them out rather than killing them. This would allow you to continue the campaign and now you have a escape situation for your players,",mixed_they
"&gt;But generally those who are virgins into their twenties haven't yet experienced a romantic relationship yet, which can be a problem for them when they seek one.

Well yeah, it can be a problem, but that's different from ""it's over"". According to the CDC, only [4%](https://flowingdata.com/2017/03/17/when-americans-lost-their-virginity/) of 43-year-old men have reported not having sex, which is the highest proportion for men &gt;30. It can and will limit somebody's dating pool, but so does every superficial flaw to varying degree

&gt;And that's not to mention the problems with sexual relationships being a virgin causes. They simply won't be able to last long and will have no clue what the fuck they're doing

That ends very quickly...

&gt;and that'll lead to a situation where their partner is repulsed sexually by them.

You underestimate the amount of people who would be patient with an inexperienced partner and overestimate the amount of experience people who know what they're doing. This paragraph just comes off as fear/insecurity.

&gt;and factor put those who save it for marriage. I'm willing to concede if the evidence proves me wrong.

I'm not sure about the 'saving it for marriage' part, but there would have to be a lot of men 'saving it for marriage' to the point where a tiny proportion of men have reported not having sex in their 30's+ if men who don't have sex by the time they hit college are (never going to be) screwed.",generic_singularthey

Equally, someone with a low sex drive doesn't HAVE to keep up with their partner, but by the same token, their partner is under no obligation to remain in an unsatisfying relationship.

And the only reason I say NTA instead of NAH is that OP's boyfriend has let his established standards slip, and it's all too common for people to work really hard and put up a false front in order to get into a relationship, only to let themselves go once they're locked in and think their partner will put up with anything.

Depends, some tribes will be happy with a pretty penny, some will tell you they are fed up with the crown and others will laugh 'cause their tribe never signed the treaty and let their land be sold.

It's safe to say, on the surface they are attempting to help, but Maori have their  own gated community problem. And some of those in Labour are only in it for themselves. In some cases I fear Labour are aiming to abolish private property rights, as opposed to actually helping Maori.

For me, if I was getting hit every day, and I was under 18, I would call child protective services. Especially if I couldn?t stay at a relatives house or a friends house. Maybe you can, though? If you call child protective services, they could help you stay somewhere else like that. 

You definitely don?t deserve to be hit. That?s abuse and no one should be abused. You have bruises to show as proof. I?m really sorry you get hit and that it?s gotten so bad, you consider suicide as a comfort to end your pain. But there are other ways to stop your pain. You don?t have to be adopted to get help. They could give you housing and support to help you get on your feet. You already have a job, so you could save up some money for a place to live later. 

Call up child protective services. Ask them what happens if you report abuse. Then you?ll know rather than just guess. 

I would also tell your teachers or principal about getting bullied. The school shouldn?t put up with any bullying. Oh, but you are too afraid to ask for help at school. I can see that. If your own father hits you, it?s hard to trust anyone will help you. But people out there will. There are so many nice people out there that aren?t like your father.

"&gt;This kind of thing is easy but the reason I wanted to make sure this reddit post came directly from Moscow is because it serves my purpose- much like it probably served the purpose of 'Guccifer' to do the same.

There is nothing probable about this. You can't just pretend there's a purpose to intentionally pretending to be a Russian spy imperfectly hiding their identity. You're not even attempting to show *why* this would be done... which was my question in the first place. 

&gt;The only thing we can learn from the 'Guccifer routing information' is that whoever set the system up did not like Russia.

If they didn't like Russia, why would they route through France all but one time? Why would they claim to not recognize the Russian language? 

&gt;When you start with a conclusion and work backwards to support that conclusion- you are going to end up with 'Aliens' every single time.

But 'Aliens' are implausible, while Russia really exists, has means motive and opportunity, and matches all of the evidence. No one else does. 

&gt;Why would they be motivated? 

Because if they admit it was their guy who was captured, it lends credence to that guy's testimony to be used against them. This should be obvious.

&gt;There was never any danger of a member directing law enforcement to other members. 

This is naive, isn't it? A member turning state's evidence would be able to communicate with other members, providing useful evidence against them based on their statements.

&gt;They would if the media says they do.

This is an unsupported assertion.

&gt;Ukraine has been throwing everything at the wall to see what sticks for the last ten years. They have no problems making things up.

Another unsupported assertion.

&gt;Yet they still have not been able to connect the dots on this one. 

Is this actually true, or are you just denying all evidence that is not official bank statements of the mobster that has no official bank statements? What is the evidence that would exist, but doesn't?

&gt;There are THOUSANDS of companies like this all over the world.

There are not thousands with this scale, that existed in 2015, and which maintained years-long campaigns to impact elections in another country. Do we agree on this?

&gt;You don't need a wealthy backer or a government intelligence network or a Putin supervillian. This is what I am trying to tell you friend. These things are so incredibly easy that if you really wanted to- you yourself could completely recreate the circumstances the Mueller report is claiming.

I don't have 120 million dollars (or whatever) to burn. You're asserting this is incredibly easy?

&gt;This is why we HAVE an evidence requirement. This is why we don't enter suspicions into the record as fact. This is why the US Federal Rules of Evidence are so strict. It eliminates all semblance of fallacy, hearsay and rumor mill and it demands something more than speculation.

But none of your objections are according to the US Federal Rules of Evidence.

"?If people suck with a 7?3 center because they can?t abuse their speed then they need to adjust or go smaller.?

So, you?re agreeing with me that many 7?3? centers will have to switch builds to be competitive online in some cases. Kind of like how pure shot creators had to create new players after the first month last year as well.

 This type of thing happens every year with 2k. This triple A publisher puts out a game that?s incomplete and, after a month, the game is completely different and builds that were dominate at first are terrible later. 

This isn?t like a first person shooter, for example, that makes balancing changes. Balancing changes in other games cause people to switch guns or whatever but it doesn?t force people to create a completely different character that that person spent an enormous amount of time and money on. That?s what 2k does every year and every year people are forced to create new builds to stay competitive. It?s sloppy and shady on their part. 

Should 7?3? centers have been as fast as they were from the jump? Absolutely not. But, if they?re going to extremely nerf a build due to their own lack of testing, they need to provide people that made those builds with some type of restitution. Something like, I don?t know, allow them to re-spec a build. I feel like I?ve heard that term before.",mixed_they

I was homeless once. I was in and out of hospitals told I may die in a few months from disease. I stood atop a bridge and with all my heart wanted to jump. I had nothing to live for and nothing to see in my future. I had spent so long crying and racking up medical expenses. I literally was happier in the hospital than the street at the time because I could ask for food and water, and it was temporary shelter. 
But then someone saw me and stopped me. Asked me to give it one more day.
I was working a retail job part time, lived on the streets, and used my money to get a gym membership where I kept my clothes and showered daily. It also came with daily free food with the membership.
I didn?t know how long I could do it.
The mri?s, the bloodwork, and the doctors saying they couldn?t tell me I wasn?t going to die.
I remember being on that bridge and wanting with all my heart to jump. What was the point of all the struggle? Why keep going when I could finally be free of it?

And I gave it one more day. 
I said, if I ever feel that down again, I?d go to the bank and take out the biggest loan I could, travel the world, and plan to kill myself at the end of it.
Why no give myself one last final giant hurrah.
So i went to Vegas.
It?s all my credit could afford me.
And that vacation I did whatever.

And here I still am. 5 years later.

I?m not rich. Some days I still struggle. 
But I can say I am glad I didn?t jump.
I have health insurance and now have gotten treatment and doctors don?t tell me I may die now.

My life and my decisions are ones the people my own age have never had to face.
I can say, my ?successful? friends still tell me they have no clue how they would even survive without a house.
I have experiences they take for granted, and they are amazing people who know my struggle and are happy to let me indulge in their amazing lives too.

"Lu Bu was so skilled in the use of his spear that they renamed the weapon after him.  The Lu Bu Spear (or Crescent moon spear) is 5 weapons in one and functions well against all the weapons Achilles has at his disposal.  Also Lu Bu was a peerless archer, again according to the stories.  At range, Lu Bu shoots him, in Melee he's better equipped and at minimum of equal skill.  

Note, legendary Achilles wins because he can't die and Lu Bu cannot reasonably know that his weakness is a strike to the heel.

Real life Achilles vs Real Life Lu Bu, I'm going to go Lu Bu simply because he was said to be more skilled than Ghan Yu and fought him and Zhang Fei to a draw.  They build temples to Ghan Yu for his martial prowess.  Mind you that might be BS as Romance of the 3 Kingdoms was highly embellished, but we don't really have much more to go off of for Achilles.  

Basically IRL Achilles and Lu Bu both were capable warriors in tremendous battles.  However, Lu Bu was in China and whereas Achilles in Greece.  Both fought and killed several great heros... Lu Bu's caliber of opponent was likely much higher and there were certainly many more of them and his Lu Bu spear is designed to straight up wreck someone with a regular spear.",plural_they

When i talk about that language use I don't think I have referred to anyone in this thread specifically but to a general trend I see.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; ""All playing is practice so it all improves you"" is a fairly generic statement.   Yes its all technically practice but not all practice is either equally  good (bad habits) or productive (inefficient). There are lots of people  who post here saying they haven't really worked hard to learn anything,  they just play what they feel like, and while they had fun they feel  lost and despondent and not inspired to play.  

&amp;#x200B;

I think it is truism, one we should keep in mind. I feel there is an obsession with perfection and efficiency from many given advice on the subreddit though and that could be stifling peoples enjoyment. 

&amp;#x200B;

In regards to people who feel despondent, I feel we should encourage them to engage in self-reflection to choose what they want to learn and not worry about the 'best' way to learn. Learn some songs by ear, look for analysis of the theory behind in a song you like or do anything else that will help you enjoy the song at the deeper level if that makes you happy. I don't think the answer is to tell them to learn modes for no reason. They should learn modes if they want to make a certain theme of music or because they heard a mode in a song they love, not for the sake of learning modes.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Your position carries a sort of all or nothing quality to it. I base  that on how you've replied to others and how you've characterized things  said. You hold a fairly absolute view and when offered nuance you react  to that nuance like its an inverse form of extremism. 

&amp;#x200B;

So my argument holds an absolute nothingness to it? I have read many counterarguments and just disagree with the framing and philosophy.

&gt; I think you're not really trying to understand the contrary perspective,  you're instead brushing it off. That's how the argument seems to go.

"The average modern ?socialist? is just an extra-zealous liberal who thinks they?re a revolutionary because they wear a hammer-and-sickle pin while espousing all the same opinions you?d hear from a corporate HR rep or a late-night talk show.

With the exception of a small minority of principled marxists, post-cold war western socialists have (without admitting it directly) given up on the idea that capitalism can ever be overthrown, and instead started searching for new categories of people to liberate.

"The telephone line had been secretly set up. President Trump waited on the other end. All President Hassan Rouhani of Iran had to do was come out of his hotel suite and walk into a secure room where Mr. Trump?s voice would be piped in via speaker.

Mr. Rouhani and his aides were blindsided by the offer, presented to them by President Emmanuel Macron of France on an unannounced visit last Tuesday night to their quarters at the Millenium Hilton Hotel near the United Nations, where world leaders had converged for the annual General Assembly.

It was a mission lifted out of a Hollywood thriller. Mr. Macron has sought for months to broker a thaw in the standoff between the United States and Iran, which has threatened to escalate into a new Middle East war.

Accompanied by a small team of advisers, Mr. Macron awaited an answer outside the Iranian leader?s suite, according to three people with knowledge of the diplomatic gambit, which was first reported on Monday by The New Yorker. Messages were passed between them via Mr. Rouhani?s aides.

In the end, Mr. Rouhani refused even to come out of his room. Mr. Macron left empty-handed and Mr. Trump was left hanging.

With no guarantee that Mr. Trump would end the onerous sanctions he has imposed on Iran, Mr. Rouhani feared he would be trapped in an encounter that Mr. Trump could exploit as a headline-grabbing success, the people with knowledge of the episode said.

It also was clear that Mr. Rouhani might suffer a political backlash at home, where hard-liners were already fuming at the mere possibility that Mr. Rouhani would consider a dialogue with Mr. Trump.

For the Iranians, however, the incident underscored what they see as Mr. Trump?s eagerness, bordering on desperation, to recreate a theatrical moment like he achieved with North Korea?s leader, Kim Jong-un, at their Singapore summit in June 2018. For them, it was a validation that their strategy of escalating tensions in response to Mr. Trump?s ?maximum pressure? campaign of sanctions was paying off.

?For Rouhani, talking to Trump is a liability,? said Ali Vaez, director of the Iran program at the International Crisis Group, a research organization on conflict resolution. Mr. Rouhani would not take such a risk, Mr. Vaez said, unless ?he knew a reward would come out of it.?

Mr. Trump?s desire for a meeting or at least a phone call with Mr. Rouhani during the General Assembly reflected what some analysts called the American leader?s broader frustrations over international problems that keep piling up.

Those frustrations have only been compounded by the congressional impeachment inquiry over Mr. Trump?s phone call with Ukraine?s president in July, in which he pushed for an investigation into former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., a leading Democratic challenger in the 2020 presidential election.

?Trump really wants a foreign policy win and can?t find one,? said Cliff Kupchan, chairman of the Eurasia Group, a political-risk consulting firm in Washington. ?He thinks talks with Iran now may be his best shot.?

Mr. Kupchan said Mr. Trump ?was especially desperate at the U.N.G.A. ? he wanted to flip the news cycle from Ukraine and Biden to a dramatic meeting with Rouhani.?

The people who recounted Mr. Macron?s ill-fated visit to Mr. Rouhani?s hotel declined to be identified by name or nationality because they were not authorized to discuss it. The White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Officials from the foreign ministries of France and Iran declined to comment.

Mr. Macron?s visit followed Mr. Trump?s speech that day at the General Assembly, in which he repeated his standard denunciations of Iran but signaled the possibility of a reconciliation, reminding the world that some of America?s current friends are former enemies.

But on Wednesday, when it was Mr. Rouhani?s turn to address the General Assembly, he appeared to all but rule out a meeting with Mr. Trump as he castigated the United States for quitting the 2015 nuclear agreement. For Iran, Mr. Rouhani said, photo opportunities must come after, not before, progress has been achieved. He did not hint that Mr. Trump had tried unsuccessfully to talk with him by phone the night before.


Richard Nephew, the former principal deputy coordinator for sanctions policy at the State Department and now a research scholar at Columbia University?s School of International and Public Affairs, said the Iranians had two reasons for keeping such an episode to themselves.

?They don?t see any upside internationally in them embarrassing Macron by showing the rebuff,? Mr. Nephew said. ?They may want this channel in the future, so why undermine it??

The second reason, he said, was that ?Rouhani may be concerned about how his opponents in Tehran would use this regardless of him having said ?no.??

For the members of Iran?s hierarchy, which has largely defined itself by hostility to the United States government since the 1979 Islamic revolution, any hint of an easing in estranged relations comes with extraordinary political risk.

At the United Nations General Assembly in particular ? the one place where Iranian and American officials could run into each other ? Iran?s leaders have gone out of their way to avoid encounters.

In 2000, President Bill Clinton and Iran?s president at the time, Mohammad Khatami, had a near encounter at the General Assembly. Aides on both sides had orchestrated a hallway handshake that was meant to look impromptu, but Mr. Khatami had a change of heart at the last minute and hid in a bathroom until Mr. Clinton and his party had left the hallway, diplomats who knew about the incident have said.

In 2013, in the midst of the Iran nuclear deal negotiations, American and Iranian officials discussed the possibility of President Barack Obama and Mr. Rouhani shaking hands at the General Assembly.

Ultimately the two only shared a phone call ? but even that was like a diplomatic thunderbolt, the first time leaders of the two countries had spoken since the Tehran hostage crisis more than three decades earlier. In Iran, hard-liners rebuked Mr. Rouhani for having spoken to Mr. Obama.

Later that year, Mr. Rouhani did not attend the funeral for the South African leader Nelson Mandela, partly over fear of getting cornered into seeing Mr. Obama. The Iranian newspaper Kayhan, a mouthpiece of Tehran?s hard-line faction, warned that the funeral would be a trap, leading to face-to-face contact ?with the head of Great Satan?s government.?

Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif of Iran accidentally ran into Mr. Obama at the sidelines of the General Assembly in 2015 and the two shook hands. But when news of the handshake leaked, Mr. Zarif sought assurances from the White House that a photograph of the handshake, taken by one of Mr. Obama?s staff members, would not be released.

Mr. Macron?s misadventure at the Millennium Hilton was not the first time he had been entangled in awkwardness involving Mr. Trump?s effort to talk with the Iranians.

According to Aftab, a semiofficial Iranian news agency, Mr. Trump made a spontaneous attempt to meet Mr. Zarif in August at the Group of 7 summit in France hosted by Mr. Macron, who had invited Mr. Zarif to discuss a potential meeting with the Americans.

Iran?s condition for accepting the invitation was that there would be no chance encounters with the American delegation, the Aftab account said.

When Mr. Macron told Mr. Trump that he would be meeting Mr. Zarif, Aftab said, Mr. Trump surprisingly insisted that he join Mr. Macron, but the French president said he had promised the Iranians there would be no such contacts.

During his meeting with Mr. Zarif, Aftab said, Mr. Macron joked that he could call Mr. Trump to join them. Mr. Zarif declined.

The persistent efforts of European leaders to broker a meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Rouhani has engendered jokes among Iranians.

They say the effort to push the two leaders into a meeting reminds them of a wedding where cousins who are locked in a family dispute encounter each other, and elders push them to kiss and make up without resolving their issues.",plural_they

"I saw two old people in the street who are caught up in a protest, I have no idea who they are or what they believe. There?s no context, they could not even be registered to vote. Also, I have videos that show literal neo-nazi?s and white supremacist cheering for Trump. Now you have to admit I?m right! 

But in all sincerity, don?t we start using some actual arguments?

First off, I don?t believe Trump or the Republican Party are actual Nazi?s. They?re fascist, and share some direct similarities between Nazi Germany. The nazi?s were fascist, and Trump and the GOP have been engaging in fascist rhetoric and actions. That?s where the direct comparisons come in. 

The main difference between the classical and contemporary incarnations of fascism (like Hitler for example) is that the version we observe today is operating within democratic systems rather than outside them.


Secondly, **Trump is getting impeached for publicly admitting to using extortion in an attempt to get a foreign power to investigate a political opponent.** Oh, and he also has stated that he?s trying to find the whistleblower which is against the law. That?s why he?s getting impeached. This is also an example of fascist behavior because trying to sabotage free elections and also trying to threaten people coming forward about corrupt behavior in the White House.

Here?s a great essay by a historian (Christopher Browning, one of the best known Holocaust experts) who goes into detail about the comparisons. I know it?s going to be *really* tempting to write it off as fake news, but unless you want to rely on random internet videos with zero context for the rest of your life in an attempt to justify your beliefs, I?d at least try to get through it.

https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2018/10/25/suffocation-of-democracy/

There are so many comparisons to be had, but let?s just start with a handful.

1. Trump?s ?America First? foreign policy (a phrase most closely associated with a group of prewar American Nazi sympathizers) 

2. Trump and the GOP not only doing nothing about but welcoming and accepting help from a hostile foreign nation who created a well funded and systematic campaign in order to interfere with our elections. They?re stated goal is destabilization. Literally everything that?s happening now, Trump trying to extort a foreign power in order to get ?dirt? on a political opponent. He?s attempting to manipulate our free elections and using foreign powers to do so. (One that?s been notoriously hostile to the US)

Oh, and he also had made inferences about the whistleblower, strongly implying we should take care of them execution-style.

3. The GOP is comfortable manipulating the rules of the democratic game to their advantage, with things like voter ID laws and gerrymandering. This is at the heart of fascism, being against and hindering free elections. 

4. Trump?s entire border policy is fascist.

5. The president using his appointed AG to use foreign influence in an attempt to discredit the United States? DOJ and intelligence agencies because of the information that came out in the Mueller report. 

6. Former White House aide Steve Bannon, for example, stated that he dreamed of creating a united cross-border front (from Brazil, through the United States and Europe, all the way to India and the Philippines) against refugees, cosmopolitanism, and anyone who supports these, including Pope Francis. This is literal fascism.

7. Trump?s anti-free speech remarks attacking the media, wanting to increase libel laws so he can sue the media for saying mean (almost always true) things about him, and wanting to revoke citizenship from people who use their first amendment right to burn the flag in protest. Oh, and publicly advocating for people who bend the knee during the national anthem to be fired! I could list even more if you?d like.  Anti-free speech and trying to suppress speech is another really big hallmark of fascism.

8. Trump?s incessant lying about easily verifiable facts and the use of the ?firehouse of falsehood.? This is a propaganda technique that?s been around for ages. Its designed to create distrust, gaslight, and sow confusion, and Trump embodies it perfectly, albeit stupidly. This is a commonly used propaganda technique utilized by authoritarian regimes. 

9. Trump?s 10 counts of trying to obstruct a legitimate investigation into himself as well as an investigation into a hostile foreign nation attempting to sway our elections. *The president attempting to be above the law.* Also, like I mentioned, trying to use the AG to do that as well as discredit the United States department of justice and intelligence agencies *because* of the information that came out due to that investigation. 

10. Using executive action in order to circumvent Congress and get money to build his wall. (That still hasn?t been built) This is bypassing checks and balances in order to get what he wants. This is somebody acting like a dictator. 


11. Browning, in his essay that I linked above, outlines some striking similarities between McConnell and Paul von Hindenburg.

&gt; Paul von Hindenburg, elected president of Germany in 1925, was endowed by the Weimar Constitution with various emergency powers to defend German democracy should it be in dire peril. Instead of defending it, Hindenburg became its gravedigger, using these powers first to destroy democratic norms and then to ally with the Nazis to replace parliamentary government with authoritarian rule. Hindenburg began using his emergency powers in 1930, appointing a sequence of chancellors who ruled by decree rather than through parliamentary majorities, which had become increasingly impossible to obtain as a result of the Great Depression and the hyperpolarization of German politics.

&gt; Because an ever-shrinking base of support for traditional conservatism made it impossible to carry out their authoritarian revision of the constitution, Hindenburg and the old right ultimately made their deal with Hitler and installed him as chancellor. Thinking that they could ultimately control Hitler while enjoying the benefits of his popular support, the conservatives were initially gratified by the fulfillment of their agenda: intensified rearmament, the outlawing of the Communist Party, the suspension first of freedom of speech, the press, and assembly and then of parliamentary government itself, a purge of the civil service, and the abolition of independent labor unions. Needless to say, the Nazis then proceeded far beyond the goals they shared with their conservative allies, who were powerless to hinder them in any significant way.",plural_they

"We?re going to have to wait a number of years to get any figure on this of course, but... I would not be surprised at all if the number of white supremacists (or white racists in general) in America will steadily rise over the next decade or so if we continue down the track we?re on now. 

The level of polarization we have in this country is pushing a lot of people to either extreme, and this isn?t just about left and right. Plus the internet allows you to connect with people all over the world who share your fringe views which 20 years ago you?d likely never come across. They can form communities and feed into each other?s biases and ideologies.

If more and more white people continue to feel demonized by the prominent left wing narrative dominating the media and culture right now then I?d be willing to bet that a chunk of them will join up with the Neo Nazis, Small enclaves of the klan, or just create new groups with one another. And even the ones who don?t will grow resentful and harbor unsavory views towards the people they feel are being placed on a pedestal above them, and who attack them needlessly. Human beings are wired to see more of the negative than the positive.

So if a teenager is watching a debate or panel on YouTube where a minority man or women shut down a question or point from someone else by saying something to the effect of ?sit down, shut the fuck up, and listen white privilege. You have no voice here, this is a POC environment and it?s our time now.? Or anything similar, then find a variety of content from people like Richard Spencer who make them feel better about it all. A portion of them will go down that path.

"I have been dealing with their poor service for two years now. It is so bad and has been going on for so long I probably have enough content to write a book. They keep saying they are working on it, but it only seems to get worse. Although I am sure the experience is different based on how many cars are in the area. I am in Orange County, California so there are a ton of Teslas that need service. I love my Tesla, but every time I take my car in I want to sell it because the service experience is so bad. I have had good experiences there, but they are extremely rare. I am convinced their poor service is the reason they had to buy my first Model X back as a lemon. They could never fix the car. My second one overall has been great, but the few times I have to bring it in for service the experience has been absolutely awful.

It takes weeks to get an appointment. I had one time it took nearly a month and a half to get service. I waited several weeks for my appointment to bring it in and then they decided to move it over to a mobile ranger. That team dropped the ball and never scheduled the appointment so another week or so went by. When I chatted with someone they acknowledged it was their mistake, but still made me wait a while to take the car in for service. After waiting forever to chat with someone and wasting probably 45 minutes chatting with them the chat session got disconnected and they never attempted to contact me. To be fair, I probably caused a week of that delay. Oh and if you try calling, they do not pick up. It just goes to a voicemail box that is full.

Then when you get there they want to give you Uber credits to get around because they ran out of loaner cars again. In the past when they ran out of Tesla loaners they would simply give you gas cars so you at least always left with a car. Someone decided at some point that they are no longer going to give loaner gas cars so whenever they run out of Teslas, they are out. I could understand giving you Uber credits if it is going to be a couple hour service visit, but not several days. This issue has become so frequent and to save myself the frustration I have decided to just spend the several hundred dollars on my own to rent a car when my car needs to go in for service.

I feel bad, but the only way to get anything done is to be really pushy with them. I cannot think of the last time I have ever had to ask for a manager anywhere else, but almost every time I bring my car in for service at Tesla I have to ask for a manager. Even then, they are mostly aloof. Probably because I am the 1,000th person that day that is having the same issue getting a loaner car or actually getting the car fixed. Occasionally you do find someone that is helpful, but they do not seem to stay with the company long.

The poor service is definitely affecting sales. I used to wholeheartedly recommend Tesla without any reservations, but now anytime I recommend a Tesla to anyone I always give the caveat that the service is absolutely awful if something goes wrong with the car. When my dad gave my sister his Tesla he decided not to buy another one because of the service experience. He loved the car. I spent probably a year convincing my mom to get one. She hates change and I had finally convinced her, but the poor service she saw me experiencing caused her to stay with Mercedes.

I just got my car back a few weeks ago from service. I had several documented instances of an issue. When I picked the car up they said there was nothing wrong with it. I tested it that night and had the same issue. I provided them videos of the issue happening multiple times. I told The manager and he said he would have an engineer look into it and get back to me last week. That never happened and based on prior experiences I don?t expect them to do what they say they are going to do. At this point I have just given up.

I still love the company, the car and the mission, but their service center is drives me to do crazy things like entertain the thought of going back to a gas car. :-)",mixed_they

A majority population stirred up by populist leaders. Build up the identity walls (""this country belongs to \[insert race/ethnic group\]"") Appeal to some real/fictional history (""we made this country great""). Use real or perceived economic, cultural, religious, security fears. Then start the rhetoric (""our security/future/wealth are being stolen by \[insert race/ethnic groups here\]"", ""they are not loyal to us"", ""they are not part of us and wish to destroy us"", ""if not for them we would be safer/wealthier/happier"" ). Then show why the discrimination, elimination and/or marginalization of other groups are justified because of the threat and illegitimacy of their presence. 

In this style of leadership, there is no such thing as principled or loyal opposition. The cause is too right and the stakes too high. Anyone who disagrees are traitors and enemies. Concession, cooperation and compromise is seen as capitulation and surrender. No action or statement is unjustified if it furthers the cause. Everything is described as a zero sum game.",plural_they

"I guess it depends on how you define ?disaster.? The only videos I?ve come across, if they used that term at all, would be talking purely in terms of attendance. It cost them about $1 billion for each park. Admittedly, I don?t really follow theme park channels. It?s funny since I actually live a little over 100 miles from Disney World and have only been there twice, but videos on it do pop up once in a while. YouTube?s algorithms are weird. 

I?ve never heard anyone root for it to fail, but there probably are some people like that out there. They see it as some kind of vindication for their views on Disney and what they?ve done with Star Wars in general. They people I have seen did have a fair amount of criticism, though. A common one I saw was how the area should have been themed to OT locations, like Tatooine or Endor instead of putting it in the Sequel trilogy era.

The other big one, and I think the main one, is that only one of the two rides (and not the one everyone wanted to see most) opened when Galaxy?s Edge opened. Going to either place is expensive and most people would probably wait till everything is open until they spend that money to go. And I get that.

Disney also kind of shot themselves in the foot by having blackout dates for their pass holders. That meant the people who would go for cheaper couldn?t go for the opening. Disney was so confident that the Star Wars brand would draw people in anyway that they were caught flat-footed when attendance was far less than they expected. A little of that was also probably TLJ backlash, but I think the vast majority is covered by having only one ride open and those blackout dates. Not to mention attendance in theme parks in general has been down a bit. People just don?t have a lot of disposable income lying around nowadays?especially if you?re going to miss out on the main ride most people wanted to see.

It also came out much later that they seriously cut back what they were going to do with the areas. If you look at some of their early ideas, they were going to have mechanical animals to ferry people around the park and have drone starship taking off and landing to give it the feel of an active spaceport. But one of the execs wanted to save money, so they kept cutting back until it was basically two rides and a shopping area. I also think at one-point Galaxy?s Edge was going to be OT-themed and it was changed to the sequel era. I can?t remember why. I want to say Iger changed it, but don?t take that as 100%

I don?t know, I think it really came down to overconfidence on Disney?s part. I think it was Iger that said something to the effect that they didn?t have to advertise Galaxy?s Edge at all and people would come anyway. And they might have, if Disney didn?t decide to get a little greedy and have blackout dates to squeeze just a little more out of people. Even then, they very well could have made a killing if it was Tatooine or Endor. Nostalgia, especially with Star Wars fans, is huge. Disney definitely has been trying to push integration with their canon (they have like 2 or 3 books that exist almost solely to tie Batuu in with the saga). And I think here is the part where the backlash came in. The other two reasons were 80-90% of the problem, but that lack of a connection for some people probably gave them the excuse not to go if they were on the fence.",plural_they

"Being downvoted by people that likely haven't ever worked there.

As a Kroger employee, my store pays the bare minimum they're legally obligated to in Texas. Federal law guarantees $7.25 an hour, Kroger in it's magnificent generosity pays most employees not in a manger position, a starting wage of $8.25 an hour. Raises are given every six months, for .50c an hour... You'd have to work at Kroger for 3 years just to start making what is considered a ""livable wage"" which is about $11.50. 

Excluding paying employees a non-livable wage merely because they're legally allowed to. They have cart pushers that work out in the Texas summer heat 4 hours a day for many people, sometimes longer or shorter depending on the day and the shift. Employee retention rate for cart pushers is absolutely awful, because they get treated like garbage and it's difficult for anyone to adapt to that physical exertion if they don't have experience, which almost nobody does. Nothing makes me feel more like shit as a Cashier than watching one of the cart pushers start bagging and looking essentially dead on their feet only to get dragged away to do something else again. 

As for offering people jobs that otherwise would never be employed, sure they do. Because it's cheap labor they'll treat like shit and take advantage of. Nothing like seeing the short bus arrive in front of the store and them having those guys go around and put away returned items for free. All in the name of ""training for their future job"". Yeah, what a gracious opportunity they're looking forward to, already being taken advantage of. 

Some people might see these as over exaggerations or complaining about something that could be far worse. But the way I see it, Kroger does the bare minimum for it's employees and could do a lot more. At least a raise in payment, so that the people who are dying on the inside working this sort of job, don't end up dead on the outside because they can't pay their bills.",mixed_they
